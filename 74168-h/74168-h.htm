<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>This book is an anthology of American Independence:
of the document that announced its
birth; of the struggle that established it in life; and
of the patriotism that was to it both sire and son.
It aims to present a clear review of the origin, spirit
and significance of Independence Day and of its
celebration both by the now discredited methods of
brutal, meaningless noise and indiscriminate carnage,
which disgraced the larger part of the previous
century, and by the recent methods of sane and
safe, reverent and meaningful celebration.</p>

<p>The volume contains a selection of the best prose
and verse that bears in any way on our nation’s
birthday; and closes with many constructive suggestions
for the celebration of our new, more beautiful
and more patriotic Fourth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p>When, on the fourth day of each July, Americans
keep the birthday of the nation we celebrate as our
greatest secular holiday, the one which has the honor
of being sanctioned by statute in every state of the
Union.</p>

<p>From times as early as any living memory can reach,
this anniversary has been observed in much the same
fashion: by spread-eagle oratory, by unlimited and
quite meaningless noise, and hospitals filled with the
wounded and dying. It is curious that the festival
should have gone on in this monotonous manner decade
after decade until nearly the middle of its second
century of life, and then suddenly should have encountered
a revolution far more abrupt than the early,
heroic one which it commemorates.</p>

<p>For our attitude toward the Fourth is undergoing
swift revolution as regards our understanding both
of the causes that underlay American independence,
of the real spirit in which the Declaration was penned,
and of the reasons why July fourth rather than some
other day was fixed upon. Finally, the swiftest
Fourth of July revolution of all is taking place in the
way we celebrate it.</p>

<p>Until quite recently all historians have, consciously
or unconsciously, been consistent in misrepresenting
the War of Seventy-Six and the events leading
thereto. And we owe no small debt of gratitude to
writers like Mr. Owen Wister and Mr. Sydney<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
George Fisher for telling us the truth. Mr. Wister
writes<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of the Revolution that while “As a war, its
real military aspect is slowly emerging from the myth
of uninterrupted patriotism and glory, universally
taught to school children, its political hue is still
thickly painted and varnished over by our writers.</p>

<p>“How many Americans know, for instance, that
England was at first extremely lenient to us? fought us
(until 1778) with one hand in a glove, and an olive
branch in the other? had any wish rather than to
crush us; had no wish save to argue us back into the
fold, and enforce argument with an occasional victory
not followed up?... For any American historian
to speak the truth on these matters is a very recent
phenomenon, their common design having been
to leave out any facts which spoil the political picture
of the Revolution they chose to paint for our edification:
a ferocious, blood-shot tyrant on the one side,
and on the other a compact band of ‘Fathers,’ down-trodden
and martyred, yet with impeccable linen and
bland legs. A wrong conception even of the Declaration
of Independence as Jefferson’s original invention
still prevails; Jefferson merely drafted the document,
expressing ideas well established in the contemporary
air. Let us suppose that some leader of our own time
were to write: ‘Three dangers to-day threaten the
United States, any one of which could be fatal: unscrupulous
capital, destroying man’s liberty to compete;
unscrupulous Labor, destroying man’s liberty
to work; and undesirable Immigration, in which four
years of naturalization are not going to counteract
four hundred years of heredity. Unless the people
check all of these, American liberty will become extinct.’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
If some one were to write a new Declaration of
Independence, containing such sentences, he could not
claim originality for them; he would be merely stating
ideas that are among us everywhere. This is what
Jefferson did, writing his sentences loosely, because
the ideas they expressed were so familiar as to render
exact definitions needless.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wister deserves gratitude for giving us these
unpalatable truths in such palatable form; but he
should have far more gratitude for introducing to a
wide body of readers his chief source of information,
the historian Mr. Sydney George Fisher, one of whose
most valuable chapters has fortunately been secured
for reproduction in the body of this book. Mr. Fisher
writes:<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>“I cannot feel satisfied with any description of the
Revolution which treats the desire for independence
as a sudden thought, and not a long growth and development,
or which assumes that every detail of the
conduct of the British government was absurdly stupid,
even from its own point of view, and that the
loyalists were few in numbers and their arguments
not worth considering....</p>

<p>“The historians seem to have assumed that we do
not want to know about that controversy” (over
Gen. Howe’s lenient methods), “or that it will be better
for us not to know about it. They have assumed
that it will be better for Americans to think that independence
was a sudden and deplorable necessity and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
not a desire of long and ardent growth and cautiously
planned intention. They have assumed that we want
to think of England as having lost the colonies by
failure to be conciliatory, and that the Revolution was
a one-sided, smooth affair, without any of the difficulties
or terrors of a rebellion or a great upheaval of
settled opinion.”</p>

<p>There can be small doubt that when this true inner
history of our independence becomes generally known
it will do much to mitigate the blind, provincial spread-eagleism
that still clings to even our safest and sanest
celebrations of the Fourth and that has so ably
thwarted every motion toward fraternal intimacy between
the two great branches of the Anglo-Saxon
race. The following<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> paragraph is fairly typical of
the British attitude toward the celebration of our national
birthday.</p>

<p>“Where a country or a government has been baffled
in its efforts to attain or preserve a hated rule
over another people, it must be content to see its failure
made the subject of never-ending triumph and
exultation. The joy attached to the sense of escape
or emancipation tends to perpetuate itself by periodical
celebrations, in which it is not likely that the motives
of the other party, or the general justice of the
case, will be very carefully considered or allowed for.
We may doubt if it be morally expedient thus to keep
alive the memory of facts which as certainly infer
mortification to one party as they do glorification to
another: but we must all admit that it is only natural,
and in a measure to be expected.”</p>

<p>When we come to view the facts as they are, to
realize of what shocking sportsmanship our own one-sided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
view of independence convicts us, we shall have
removed one of the chief obstacles to Anglo-Saxon
solidarity. But it will be necessary first to learn
something about the day we celebrate. How many,
for instance, even know that July fourth was fixed
upon as a compromise date between two other rival
claimants?</p>

<p>Walsh writes:<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>“It may not be generally known that no less than
three dates might reasonably compete for designation
as the natal day of American Independence and for
the honors of the anniversary of that event.</p>

<p>“On the second of July, 1776, was adopted the resolution
of independence, the sufficient legislative act;
and it was this day that Mr. Adams designated as the
anniversary in the oft-quoted letter written on his desk
at the time, prophesying its future celebration, by
bells, bonfires, cannonades, etc. On the fourth of
July occurred the Declaration of Independence. On
the second of August following took place the ceremony
of signature, which has furnished to the popular
imagination the common pictorial and dramatic conceptions
of the event.</p>

<p>“The history connecting these three dates may be
intelligently told in a brief space. On the fifteenth of
May, 1776, a convention in Virginia had instructed its
delegates in the General Congress ‘to propose to that
body to declare the United Colonies free and independent
States, absolved from all allegiance to or
dependence on the Crown or Parliament of Great
Britain, and that they give the assent of this Colony
to such declaration, and to whatever measures may
be thought proper and necessary by the Congress for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
forming foreign alliances and a confederation of the
Colonies.’ The motion thus ordered was on the seventh
of June made in Congress by Richard Henry Lee,
as the oldest member of the Virginia delegation. It
was to the effect that ‘these United Colonies are, and
of right ought to be, free and independent States;
that they are absolved from all allegiance to the
British crown; and that all political connection between
them and the state of Great Britain is, and
ought to be, totally dissolved.’ The resolution was
slightly debated for two or three days, but from considerations
of prudence or expediency the discussion
was intermitted. As texts for the action of Congress
there were the resolution referred to, and the more
formal, or at least more lengthy, document which the
committee of five—Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Sherman,
and Livingston—had been instructed on the
eleventh of June to prepare. This document was
draughted by Jefferson and presented under the title
of ‘A Declaration by the Representatives of the
United States of America in General Congress assembled.’</p>

<p>“On the first of July there was again called up in
Congress the resolution proposed by Mr. Lee. On
the second of July it passed. Two days later (the
fourth of July) was adopted, after various amendments,
the ‘Declaration’ from Mr. Jefferson’s pen.
The document was authenticated, like the other papers
of the Congress, by the signature of the president and
the secretary, and, in addition, was signed by the members
<i>present</i>, with the exception of Mr. Dickinson of
Pennsylvania, who, as Mr. Jefferson has testified, ‘refused
to sign it.’</p>

<p>“But it did not then bear the names of the members<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
of Congress as they finally appeared on it. A number
of these still opposed it, and had voted against it; it
was passed unanimously only as regarded states.
Thus, a majority of the Pennsylvania delegation had
persistently opposed it, and it was only the absence of
two of their delegates on the final vote that left a
majority for this state in its favor. Some days after
the Declaration had thus passed, and had been proclaimed
at the head of the army, it was ordered by
Congress that it be engrossed on parchment and signed
by every member; and it was not until the second of
August that these signatures were made, and the matter
concluded by this peculiar and august ceremony of
personal pledges in the autographs of the members.
It is this copy or form of the Declaration which has,
in fact, been preserved as the original: the first signed
paper does not exist, and was probably destroyed as
incomplete.</p>

<p>“If the natal day of American Independence is to
be derived from the ceremony of these later signatures,
and the real date of what has been preserved as
the legal original of the Declaration, then it would
be the second of August. If derived from the substantial,
legal <i>act</i> of separation from the British
Crown, which was contained rather in the resolution
of Congress than in its Declaration of Independence,
it would be the second of July. But common consent
has determined to date the great anniversary from the
apparently subordinate event of the passage of the
Declaration, and thus celebrates the Fourth of July
as the birthday of the nation.”</p>

<p>Finally, after making ourselves reasonably intelligent
as to the origin, spirit and true significance of Independence
Day it behooves us as true Americans to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
enter the splendid new movement which is endeavoring
to make the Fourth over from a day of shallow jingoism
and unmeaning brutality and carnage into a day
of initiation into the meaning of true citizenship and a
festival of deep and genuine and beautiful patriotism.</p>

<h3>THE GREAT AMERICAN HOLIDAY</h3>

<p class="author">ANONYMOUS</p>

<p>Among all the holidays of the year, one stands out
as preëminently American; one appeals especially to
that sentiment of patriotism and national pride which
glows in every loyal American heart. Independence
Day—the Fourth of July—is observed in every
State in the Union as our distinctive national holiday;
and rightly so, for the event which it celebrates is by
far the most important in American history—an
event no less, indeed, than the birth of the nation.</p>

<p>Independence Day celebrates the signing, on the
Fourth of July, 1776, of the paper which declared
this country forever free from British rule. It had
been under consideration for some time by the Continental
Congress, assembled at Philadelphia, and final
action was finally taken on July 4. From that time
forward, the American colonists were no longer rebels
in arms against their country, but a free people fighting
for their independence.</p>

<p>That the Declaration of Independence was mainly
the work of Thomas Jefferson has been established
beyond reasonable doubt; and it stands to-day one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
the most remarkable state papers in the history of the
world.</p>

<p>At the time of the passage of the act, John Adams
wrote to his wife a letter which has become historic.
“I am apt to believe,” he wrote, “that this day will
be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great
anniversary festival. It ought to be commemorated
as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion
to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp
and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires,
and illuminations, from one end of this continent
to the other, from this time forward forevermore.”</p>

<p>Bonfires and guns there have been without limit;
and the deaths that have resulted from these celebrations
would form no inconsiderable fraction of
those lost during the Revolution. For years, the celebration
of this great holiday has consisted mainly of
meaningless noise; but there is a steadily growing
sentiment in favor of a more worthy observance of
the day, as a time when every loyal American should
rejoice in the welfare of his country, and recall with
pride the manner in which the Nation was established.</p>

<h3>HOW THE FOURTH OF JULY SHOULD BE CELEBRATED</h3>

<p class="author">BY JULIA WARD HOWE</p>

<p>I have been invited to present some hints as to the
proper observance of our great national holiday, the
Fourth of July, and the false education implied by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
warlike celebrations in a nation whose corner stone is
peace and whose freedom is a standing protest against
old-world militarism.</p>

<p>The topic carries me back in thought to days of
childhood, when, in my native city of New York, the
endless crackling of torpedoes, the explosion of firecrackers
and the booming of cannon, made the day
one of joyous confusion and fatigue, culminating in
a distant view of the city fireworks sent up from Castle
Garden. It then seemed to be a day wholly devoted
to boyish pleasure and mischief, sure to be followed
by reports of hairbreadth escapes and injuries more
or less serious, sometimes even fatal. The day was
one of terror to parents, who, while deeming it unwise
to interdict to their sons the enjoyment of gunpowder,
dreaded to see them maimed or disfigured for
life by some unlooked-for accident. It was not uncommon
then, nor is it now, to read of some sudden
death, some irretrievable blindness or other injury
caused by the explosion of a toy cannon or the misadventure
of some fireworks on “the Fourth,” as the
day has come to be called.</p>

<p>These were tragical events truly, but they appear
less real to me in remembrance than do the laughing
faces of my young brothers who were allowed to
arrange a small table for their greater convenience
on the pavement of ancient Bond Street, a very quiet
byway in those days. From this spot went forth a
perpetual popping and fizzing, varied by the occasional
thud of a double-headed firecracker. Shouts of
merriment followed these explosions. The girls
within doors enjoyed the fracas from the open windows,
and in the evening our good elders brought
forth a store of Roman candles, blue lights, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
rockets. I remember a year, early in the thirties, in
which good Gideon Lee, a democratic Mayor of New
York, issued an edict prohibitive of all home fireworks.
Just as we had settled ourselves in the determination
to regard him thenceforth as our natural
enemy, the old gentleman’s heart failed him, and, living
next door to us, he called to say that he would
make a few exceptions to the rule for the day, and
that we should count among these.</p>

<p>Removing to Boston some ten years later, I found
the night of the third of July rendered almost sleepless
by the shrill gamut of gunpowder discharges.
The ringing of bells and the booming of cannon destroyed
the last chance of an early morning nap, and
in self-defense most people left their beds and went
forth to see what could be seen. This was sometimes
a mock procession of the Antiques and Horribles,
so called in parody of the Ancient and Honorable
Artillery, so well known in and about Boston.
Or, one might join the throng on the Common, where
a brass band performed popular airs, American and
Irish-American. I do indeed recall certain notable
performances connected with the usual observance of
the National Festival. I was a dweller in Boston
when Charles Sumner, then chiefly known as a rising
lawyer and incipient philanthropist, was appointed to
deliver the Fourth of July oration, and chose for
his theme the true grandeur of nations. This
grandeur he found entirely in the conquests of peace
as opposed to the popular worship of military renown.
His audience, composed in part of men in
soldier’s garb, were but little in sympathy with his
views, and I remember the performance as having
called forth more irritation than approbation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>These prophetic glimpses of good which seem far
from the practical questions of the time do visit
earnest souls in this way, like some ray of light from
an undiscovered star. The same train of thought, at
about the same time, took shape in Mr. Longfellow’s
fine poem on the Arsenal in Springfield. It may be
remembered that the poet was Mr. Sumner’s most
intimate friend. While the two men held the same
views regarding the great questions of the time, Mr.
Longfellow’s <i>bonhomie</i> rendered him very inapt to
give offense, while Sumner seemed destined to arouse
violent opposition in those from whom he differed.</p>

<p>I remember another Fourth of July at which Edward
Everett’s measured rhetoric and silver voice held
the attention of a numerous assemblage. Mr. Everett
was certainly master of the art of graceful oratory,
and was always heard with appreciation, even by those
who felt little satisfaction in his public career.</p>

<p>One of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s finest poems was
written for the celebration of the Fourth in his own
town of Concord. The two opening lines of this dwell
always in my memory:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh! tenderly the haughty Day</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fills his blue urn with fire.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But, beautiful as they are, the solemn lesson of the
poet exceeds them in interest.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“United States! the Ages plead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Present and Past in under-song;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go, put your creed into your deed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Nor speak with double tongue.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Be just at home, then write your scroll</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of honor o’er the sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bid the broad Atlantic roll</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A ferry of the Free.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Here is a thought picture which we may love to
dwell upon. Emerson, the descendant of the Puritans,
himself a transfigured Puritan, reading these
stanzas of his, whose fire is tempered by the weight
of thought, in that old town of Concord, where, in
his own phrase:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“—the embattled farmers stood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And fired the shot heard round the world.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A fiercer fight was then before us, whose issue is
simply prefigured in the words: “<i>Be just at home</i>.”
Surely, we might take this saying for a national
motto, its reminder still needed, though the slave is
freed from the whip and fetter. Of the day on which
our Independence was declared John Adams said:</p>

<p>“It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance
by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty.
It ought to be celebrated with pomp and parade, with
shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations,
from one end of this continent to the other,
from this time forward forevermore.”</p>

<p>These words show how comprehensive was the view
which the old statesman took of a Nation’s holiday.
He desired that all classes and all ages should participate
in the joy expressed. The time which has
elapsed since his memorable utterance has brought
nothing to diminish this joy. It has however brought
into being a new society for which “pomp and parade,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
bells, guns and bonfires” are less available for good
than pleasures of a more elevated character. We
now desire a celebration which shall speak less to
the bodily sense and more to the inner sense. This
is because the historic development of the race goes
ever forward. John Adams would have had both
sober and wild rejoicing over the birth of a new state,
representing a new order of things. We stand face
to face with the question: How shall we maintain
our deliverance from old-world trammels? This freedom
which was declared in 1776, what are its conditions,
what its true uses?</p>

<p>History is full of paradoxes whose meaning does
not lie upon the surface of what we see. Many of
these recall the riddle of Samson: “Out of the eater
came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth
sweetness.” Even so, the things that make for peace
often come out of contests full of violence and bloodshed,
while the elements of anarchy ripen best in the
submission enforced by autocratic despotism, the
ominous quiet which is sure to be broken by some
terrific social cataclysm. In the first instance, which
alone concerns our theme, we must remember that
the bloodshed came, not of the peaceable principles of
eternal justice, but of the effort on the part of
tyrants to gainsay and oppose these. It follows from
this that in commemorating the events which have
had most to do with the liberation of mankind from
the yoke of despotism and superstition, we must keep
in view these underlying truths which in themselves
involve no violence, but the vindication of which may
involve great sacrifices of devoted lives.</p>

<p>The fact that our heroes fought for freedom against
almost hopeless odds should be brought to mind, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
their names should be hallowed in perpetual remembrance.
But, if we would crown their conquest, we
must give more attention to the good for which they
died than to the mere circumstance of their death.
The ordinary procedure of mankind is quite the opposite
of this. They are proud of the military success,
careless of the civic and ethical gain. Even
the Christian church accentuates too much the death
of its Founder, is too little concerned with the truth
for which he really gave his life. A Lent of prayer
and fasting, with dramatic repetition of the betrayal
and crucifixion of the Blessed One, may merely bring
with it suggestions of devotion and gratitude. But
far more important would be a Lent of study of the
deep meaning of his words and works. It makes one
sick at heart to think of the formal rehearsal of great
events by those who have no understanding of their
true significance, and can therefore claim but a small
part in their real benefit.</p>

<p>The parallelisms too of history are very instructive.
In the confusions and difficulties of our own time it
is useful for us to learn that men in other times have
had similar problems to solve, and have found their
solutions. It is helpful for us to know that our pure
and blameless Washington was, in his day, the subject
of malignant slander and mischievous cabal. Our
own best public men are liable to the grossest misinterpretations
of their utterances and of their
measures. Unworthy demagogues to-day will present
very dangerous evils in a light attractive to the multitude.
This has always been so. No man marches
to victory over a bed of roses. The roses crown his
perseverances, but the thorns lacerate his bleeding
feet. But, with these sad recollections, we must keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
in sight the immortal hope sung by the poets, reasoned
out by the philosophers, and acted out by earth’s saints
and heroes, the hope which is justified by the great
progress of the ages, the elevation of the natural man
into the dignity of the spiritual man.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who saw one of the
great Italian festivals in which the poet Dante was
especially commemorated, saw also the pressing need
of wise counsel and brave action throughout the
struggling country, and asks what will become of the
new Italy if her young men shall “stand still strewing
violets all the time?” We may ask too what will
become of our new Republic if the hours of its highest
festival continue to be occupied with fustian oratory,
gunpowder enthusiasm, and the exercise of every poor
and mean trade, the sale of toys, bad food, and worse
liquor?</p>

<p>Now, I would by no means abridge the childish
pleasure of the day, if I could do so. We must allow
children the explosion of animal spirits, and they will
delight, as some grown-up people will, in much that
is irrational. But the day itself is too important to
be made one of mere noise and parade. It should be
made highly valuable for impressing upon the minds
of the young the history of their national liberty, and
its cause. Besides our own young people, we have
with us the youth of many nations, whose parents
have come to our shores, drawn by various hopes of
gain and benefit. These children will form an important
part of our future body politic, in whose government
to-day, their parents are, too, easily able to
participate.</p>

<p>The question will be, how to make the Fourth of
July a true festival, a national solemnity, without forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
the claims of the young to be amused, as well
as to be instructed. In the first place, I should think
that the day might fitly be made one of reunion, by
different clubs and associations of culture and philanthropy.
Those whose thoughts go deep enough to understand
the true conditions of human freedom, might
meet and compare their studies and experiences.
Very fitly, after such a meeting, each individual of
them might seek a group, to whose members he might
present a popular statement of the philosophy of freedom.
Mothers, who should be the true guardians of
peace, might well come together to study all that promotes
its maintenance. In gatherings of older children,
prize essays might be presented and discussed.
I can imagine civic banquets, of a serious and stately
character, in which men and women might sit together
and pledge each other, in the exhilaration of friendship
and good feeling.</p>

<p>I would have processions, but I would have them
less military in character, and more pacific in suggestion.
Congregations of the various religious confessions
might walk in order, headed by their ministers,
who should all exchange the right hand of
fellowship with each other. I would have no monster
concerts, which cannot be fully enjoyed, but divers
assemblages, at which music of the highest order
should be presented. Letters of greeting should be
exchanged between cities and states, and the device
of the day should be, “In the Name of the Republic.”
The history of the war which culminated in our
national independence should be amply illustrated by
graphic lectures, and possibly by living pictures. Mr.
John Fiske has an admirable talent for bringing the
past and its heroes as vividly before us as if he himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
had seen them but the day before. If it were
possible to multiply his valued personality, I would
have many sketches given in various places, of the
brave struggle of our forefathers and of those who
were foremost in it.</p>

<p>“Going out of town to avoid the Fourth,” has been
a phrase so common in my time that it ceases to
awaken attention, and is taken as a matter of course.
I cannot indeed wonder that people of refined tastes
and sensitive nerves should seek to free themselves
from the noise and crowd of the usual observance.
The question is whether, with a wiser administration,
the same people might not be led to gather, rather than
to disperse for the celebration.</p>

<p>How would the following programme answer?</p>

<p>On the evening of the third of July, quiet gatherings
in halls or churches, in which the true love of
country should be explained and illustrated. How
many a name, half or wholly forgotten, would then be
recalled from oblivion, and with it the labor and sacrifice
of some noble life, some example precious for
the community!</p>

<p>The morning of the Fourth to be ushered in by
martial music, and a military display sufficient to recall
the services of the brave men who gave our
fathers liberty. At ten o’clock orations in various
public buildings, the ablest speakers of the commonwealth
doing their best to impart the lesson of the
day. At one a Spartan feast, wholesome and simple.
No liquor to be served thereat, and none to be sold
during the day. From twelve to half past four in the
afternoon, I would have exercises for the children of
the public schools, examination of classes in American
history, prizes given for essays on historical and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
patriotic subjects. Later, a gathering in public gardens,
and a tea, with fruit and flowers, served for the
children of the city. In the evening, the singing of
national anthems, <i>tableaux vivants</i> and fireworks, and
in some form, a pastoral benediction.</p>

<p>To these exercises I would add the signing of a
pledge of good citizenship. We take much pains, and
not unwisely, to persuade men and women to sign a
pledge of total abstinence from alcoholic liquors. But
why should we not go further than this, and lead them
to pledge themselves to some useful service in the
community? This pledge might be either general or
particular in its terms, but the act of signing it should
imply a disinterested public service of some sort, a
participation in some work useful for the health,
beauty, or order of the city, without other reward than
the badge or button which would represent the agreement
entered into. I would have the history of other
Republics brought forward on this day, and especially,
the heroic struggles of our own time. Among these,
I would certainly accord a place to the story of the
great-hearted men to whom Italy owes her freedom.
And I would if I could compel the attendance of our
men and women of fashion upon lectures in which
the true inwardness of European society should be
exposed, and the danger shown of the follies and
luxurious pomp which they delight in imitating, and
which, however æsthetically adorned and disguised, are
for us to lead in the pathway of moral and intellectual
deterioration.</p>

<p>I would have the great political offenses of the century
fitly shown, the crimes of Louis Napoleon, the
rapacious wars of Germany, France and England, the
wicked persecution of the Jews. Now that we are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
nearing the close of our nineteenth century, it becomes
most important for us that its historic record
should be truly rehearsed, its great saints and sinners
characterized, its wonderful discoveries and inventions
explained.</p>

<p>The very meager programme suggested here for our
great day may appear to many Utopian and impossible.
I shall be glad if it can serve to pave the way
for kindred suggestions, to which individual minds
may give a broader and more varied scope. Let us
unite our efforts in behalf of a suitable and serious
honoring of the day in such wise that every heart, old
and young, shall have therein its especial joy, and
every mind its especial lesson.</p>

<p>I had at one time a plan of my own, of setting apart
one day in the year as a Mother’s Day. This festival
was to be held in the interest of a world’s peace, and
for quite a number of years it was so observed by
groups of women in various parts of the country,
while in England and even in far-off Smyrna friends
met together, with song, prayer, and earnest discourse
to emphasize the leading thought, which was
that women, as the mothers of the race, knowing
fully the cost of human life, should unite their efforts
throughout the world to restrain the horrors of war,
and to persuade men to keep the sacred bond of
peace. It now occurs to me that we should make our
Fourth of July a Mother’s, as well as a Father’s day.
In the public programme of every town throughout
our vast Commonwealth, women should have some
word to say and some part to play. What we have
already seen of their culture and ability is enough to
assure us that their participation in such proceedings
would intensify their good features and discourage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
their objectionable ones. And as in the forms of
oratory with which we are familiar, much is made
of what the world owes to America, we might suggest
that our women speakers might especially bring
forward the antithesis of this question, in another, viz.,
What America owes to the world.</p>

<h3>ENGLAND AND AMERICA</h3>

<p class="author">BY JAMES BRYCE</p>

<p>This is a memorable day to Englishmen as well as
to Americans. It is to us a day both of regret and
of rejoicing: of regret at the severance of the political
connection which bound the two branches of our
race together, and of regret even more for the unhappy
errors which brought that severance about, and
the unhappy strife by which the memory of it was
embittered. But it is also a day of rejoicing, for it
is the birthday of the eldest daughter of England—the
day when a new nation, sprung from our own,
first took its independent place in the world. And
now with the progress of time, rejoicing has prevailed
over regret, and we in England can at length
join heartily with you in celebrating the beginning
of your national life. All sense of bitterness has
passed away, and been replaced by sympathy with all
which this anniversary means to an American heart.</p>

<p>England and America now understand one another
far better than they ever did before. In 1776 there
was on one side a monarch and a small ruling caste,
on the other side a people. Now our government can
no longer misrepresent the nation, and across the
ocean a people speaks to a people. We have both
come, and that most notably within recent months, to
perceive that all over the world the interests of
America and of England are substantially the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>The sense of our underlying unity over against the
other races and forms of civilization has been a potent
force in drawing us together. It is said that the
Fourth of July is a day of happy augury for mankind.
This is true because on that day America entered
on a course and proclaimed principles of government
which have been of profound significance for
mankind. Many nations have had a career of conquest
and of civilizing dominion: but to make an immense
people prosperous, happy, and free is a nobler
and grander achievement than the most brilliant conquests
and the widest dominion.</p>

<h3>THE BIRTHDAY OF THE NATION</h3>

<p class="center smaller">(From address delivered July 4, 1851, at laying the cornerstone
of the new wing of the Capitol.)</p>

<p class="author">BY DANIEL WEBSTER</p>

<p>This is that day of the year which announced to
mankind the great fact of American Independence!
This fresh and brilliant morning blesses our vision
with another beholding of the birthday of our Nation;
and we see that Nation, of recent origin, now among
the most considerable and powerful, and spreading
from sea to sea over the continent.</p>

<p>On the fourth day of July, 1776, the representatives
of the United States of America, in Congress
assembled, declared that these Colonies are, and ought
to be, free and independent States. This declaration,
made by most patriotic and resolute men, trusting in
the justice of their cause and the protection of
Heaven,—and yet not without deep solicitude and
anxiety—has now stood for seventy-five years. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
was sealed in blood. It has met dangers and overcome
them. It has had detractors, and abashed them
all. It has had enemies, and conquered them. It has
had doubting friends, but it has cleared all doubts
away; and now, to-day, raising its august form higher
than the clouds, twenty millions of people contemplate
it with hallowed love, and the world beholds it, and
the consequences that have followed from it, with profound
admiration.</p>

<p>This anniversary animates and gladdens all American
hearts. On other days of the year we may be
party men, indulging in controversies more or less
important to the public good. We may have likes and
dislikes, and we may maintain our political differences,
often with warm, and sometimes with angry feelings.
But to-day we are Americans all; nothing but Americans.</p>

<p>As the great luminary over our heads, dissipating
fogs and mist, now cheers the whole atmosphere, so
do the associations connected with this day disperse
all sullen and cloudy weather in the minds and feelings
of true Americans. Every man’s heart swells
within him. Every man’s port and bearing becomes
somewhat more proud and lofty as he remembers that
seventy-five years have rolled away, and that the great
inheritance of Liberty is still his,—his, undiminished
and unimpaired; his, in all its original glory; his to
enjoy; his to protect; his to transmit to future generations.</p>

<h3>LIFT UP YOUR HEARTS</h3>

<p class="author">ANONYMOUS</p>

<p><i>Sursum corda.</i> We have in our own time seen the
Republic survive an irrepressible conflict, sown in the
blood and marrow of the social order. We have seen
the Federal Union, not too strongly put together in
the first place, come out of a great war of sections
stronger than when it went into it, its faith renewed,
its credit rehabilitated, and its flag saluted with love
and homage by sixty millions of God-fearing men
and women, thoroughly reconciled and homogeneous.
We have seen the Federal Constitution outlast the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
strain, not merely of a Reconstructory ordeal and a
Presidential impeachment, but a disputed count of the
Electoral vote, a Congressional deadlock, and an extra
constitutional tribunal, yet standing firm against
the assaults of its enemies, while yielding itself with
admirable flexibility to the needs of the country and
the time. And finally we saw the gigantic fabric of
the Federal Government transferred from the hands
that held it a quarter of a century to other hands, without
a protest, although so close was the poll in the
final count that a single blanket might have covered
both contestants for the Chief Magisterial office.
With such a record behind us, who shall be afraid of
the future?</p>

<p>The young manhood of the country may take this
lesson from those of us who lived through times that
did indeed try men’s souls—when, pressed down
from day to day by awful responsibilities and suspense,
each night brought a terror with every thought
of the morrow, and when, look where we would, there
were light and hope nowhere—that God reigns and
wills, and that this fair land is and has always been
in His own keeping.</p>

<p>The curse of slavery is gone. It was a joint
heritage of woe, to be wiped out and expiated in
blood and flame. The mirage of the Confederacy has
vanished. It was essentially bucolic, a vision of Arcadie,
the dream of a most attractive economic fallacy.
The Constitution is no longer a rope of sand.
The exact relation of the States to the Federal Government,
left open to double construction by the authors
of our organic being, because they could not
agree among themselves, and union was the paramount
object, has been clearly and definitely fixed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
the three last amendments to the original chart, which
constitute the real treaty of peace between the North
and the South, and seal our bonds as a nation forever.</p>

<p>The Republic represents at last the letter and the
spirit of the sublime Declaration. The fetters that
bound her to the earth are burst asunder. The rags
that degraded her beauty are cast aside. Like the
enchanted princess in the legend, clad in spotless raiment
and wearing a crown of living light, she steps
in the perfection of her maturity upon the scene of
this, the latest and proudest of her victories, to bid
welcome to the world.</p>

<p>Need I pursue the theme? This vast assemblage
speaks with a resonance and meaning which words can
never reach. It speaks from the fields that are
blessed by the never-failing waters of the Kennebec
and from the farms that sprinkle the valley of the
Connecticut with mimic principalities more potent and
lasting than the real; it speaks in the whirr of the
mills of Pennsylvania and in the ring of the wood-cutter’s
axe from the forests of the lake peninsulas;
it speaks from the great plantations of the South and
West, teeming with staples that insure us wealth and
power and stability, yea, from the mines and forests
and quarries of Michigan and Wisconsin, of Alabama
and Georgia, of Tennessee and Kentucky far
away to the regions of silver and gold, that have linked
the Colorado and the Rio Grande in close embrace,
and annihilated time and space between the Atlantic
and the Pacific; it speaks in one word, from the
hearthstone in Iowa and Illinois, from the home in
Mississippi and Arkansas, from the hearts of seventy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
millions of fearless, freeborn men and women, and
that one word is “Union!”</p>

<p>There is no geography in American manhood.
There are no sections to American fraternity. It
needs but six weeks to change a Vermonter into a
Texan, and there has never been a time, when, upon
the battle-field, or the frontier, Puritan and Cavalier
were not convertible terms, having in the beginning
a common origin, and so diffused and diluted on
American soil as no longer to possess a local habitation
or a nativity, except in the National unit.</p>

<p>The men who planted the signals of American civilization
upon that sacred Rock by Plymouth Bay
were Englishmen, and so were the men who struck
the coast a little lower down, calling their haven of
rest after the great Republican commoner, and founding
by Hampton Roads a race of heroes and statesmen,
the mention of whose names brings a thrill to
every heart. The South claims Lincoln, the immortal,
for its own; the North has no right to reject
Stonewall Jackson, the one typical Puritan soldier of
the war, for its own! Nor will it! The time is coming,
is almost here, when hanging above a mantel-board
in fair New England—glorifying many a cottage in
the sunny South—shall be seen bound together, in
everlasting love and honor, two cross swords carried
to battle respectively by the grandfather who wore the
blue and the grandfather who wore the gray.</p>

<p>God bless our country’s flag! and God be with us
now and ever. God in the roof-tree’s shade and God
on the highway, God in the winds and waves, and
God in our hearts!</p>

<h3>ENGLAND AND THE FOURTH OF JULY</h3>

<p class="author">BY W. T. STEAD</p>

<p class="center smaller">(From <i>The Independent</i>.)</p>

<p>I wish with all my heart that we could adopt the
Fourth of July as the Festival Day of the whole
English-speaking race. If this suggestion should seem
strange to Americans, it is not unfamiliar to many
Englishmen. We consider that the triumph of the
American revolt against George III was a vindication
of the essentially English idea of democratic self-government,
and we believe that we have benefited by
it almost as much as the Americans. It taught us
a lesson which made the British Colonial Empire a
possibility, and if we are now involved in a suicidal
war in South Africa, it is largely because our Government
has forgotten the principles of George Washington,
and has gone back to the principles of George
III.</p>

<p>For some years past I have presided at a distinctly
British celebration of the Fourth of July at my
brother’s settlement in Southeast London, at Browning
Hall, and I have always repudiated the idea that
Americans should be allowed to monopolize the
Fourth of July. It is one of the great days of the
English-speaking race in the celebration of which all
members of the English-speaking nations should
participate.</p>

<h3>SOME EARLY INDEPENDENCE DAY ADDRESSES</h3>

<h4>ADDRESS OF JOEL BARLOW (JULY 4, 1787)</h4>

<p class="center smaller">(At Hartford, Conn.)</p>

<p>On the anniversary of so great an event as the
birth of the empire in which we live, none will question
the propriety of passing a few moments in contemplating
the various objects suggested to the mind
by the important occasion; and while the nourishment,
the growth, and even the existence of our empire depend
upon the united efforts of an extensive and divided
people, the duties of this day ascend from
amusement and congratulation to a serious patriotic
employment.</p>

<p>We are assembled, not to boast, but to realize, not
to inflate our national vanity by a pompous relation
of past achievements in the council or the field, but,
from a modest retrospect of the truly dignified part
already acted by our countrymen, from an accurate
view of our present situation, and from an anticipation
of the scenes that remain to be unfolded, to discern
and familiarize the duties that still await us as
citizens, as soldiers, and as men.</p>

<p>Revolutions in other countries have been affected
by accident. The faculties of human reason and the
rights of human nature have been the sport of chance
and the prey of ambition. When indignation has
burst the bands of slavery, to the destruction of one
tyrant, it was only to impose the manacles of another.
This arose from the imperfection of that early
stage of society, the foundations of empires being laid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
in ignorance, with a total inability of foreseeing the
improvements of civilization, or of adapting government
to a state of social refinement. On the western
continent a new task, totally unknown to the legislators
of other nations, was imposed upon the fathers
of the American empire. Here was a people, lords
of the soil on which they trod, commanding a prodigious
length of coast, and an equal breadth of
frontier, a people habituated to liberty, professing a
mild and benevolent religion, and highly advanced in
science and civilization. To conduct such a people in
a revolution, the address must be made to reason, as
well as the passions.</p>

<p>In what other age or nation has a people, at ease
upon their own farms, secure and distant from the
approach of fleets and armies, tide-waiters and stamp-masters,
reasoned, before they had felt, and, from the
dictates of duty and conscience, encountered dangers,
distress, and poverty, for the sake of securing to posterity
a government of independence and peace?
Here was no Cromwell to inflame the people with
bigotry and zeal; no Cæsar to reward his followers
with the spoils of vanquished foes; and no territory
to be acquired by conquest. Ambition, superstition,
and avarice, those universal torches of war, never
illumined an American field of battle. But the permanent
principles of sober policy spread through the
colonies, roused the people to assert their rights, and
conducted the revolution. Those principles were
noble, as they were new and unprecedented in the
history of human nations. The majority of a great
people, on a subject which they understand, will never
act wrong.</p>

<p>Our duty calls us to act worthy of the age and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
country that gave us birth. Every possible encouragement
for great and generous exertions is presented
before us. The natural resources are inconceivably
various and great. The enterprising genius of the
people promises a most rapid improvement in all the
arts that embellish human nature. The blessings of
a rational government will invite emigrations from the
rest of the world and fill the empire with the worthiest
and happiest of mankind; while the example of political
wisdom and sagacity, here to be displayed, will
excite emulation through the kingdoms of the earth,
and meliorate the condition of the human race.</p>

<h4>ADDRESS OF JOHN QUINCY ADAMS (JULY 4, 1793)</h4>

<p class="center smaller">(At Boston.)</p>

<p>Americans! let us pause for a moment to consider
the situation of our country at that eventful day when
our national existence commenced. In the full possession
and enjoyment of all those prerogatives for
which you then dared to adventure upon “all the
varieties of untried being,” the calm and settled
moderation of the mind is scarcely competent to conceive
the tone of heroism to which the souls of freemen
were exalted in that hour of perilous magnanimity.</p>

<p>Seventeen times has the sun, in the progress of his
annual revolution, diffused his prolific radiance over
the plains of independent America. Millions of
hearts, which then palpitated with the rapturous glow
of patriotism, have already been translated to brighter
worlds; to the abodes of more than mortal freedom.</p>

<p>Other millions have arisen, to receive from their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
parents and benefactors an inestimable recompense of
their achievements.</p>

<p>A large proportion of the audience, whose benevolence
is at this moment listening to the speaker of
the day, like him, were at that period too little advanced
beyond the threshold of life to partake of the
divine enthusiasm which inspired the American
bosom; which prompted her voice to proclaim defiance
to the thunders of Britain; which consecrated the
banners of her armies; and finally erected the holy
temple of American Liberty over the tomb of departed
tyranny.</p>

<p>It is from those who have already passed the
meridian of life; it is from you, ye venerable assertors
of the rights of mankind, that we are to be
informed what were the feelings which swayed
within your breasts and impelled you to action; when,
like the stripling of Israel, with scarcely a weapon to
attack, and without a shield for your defense, you
met and, undismayed, engaged with the gigantic greatness
of the British power.</p>

<p>Untutored in the disgraceful science of human
butchery; destitute of the fatal materials which the
ingenuity of man has combined to sharpen the scythe
of death; unsupported by the arm of any friendly
alliance, and unfortified against the powerful assaults
of an unrelenting enemy, you did not hesitate at that
moment, when your coasts were infested by a formidable
fleet, when your territories were invaded by a
numerous and veteran army, to pronounce the sentence
of eternal separation from Britain, and to throw
the gauntlet at a power, the terror of whose recent
triumphs was almost coextensive with the earth.</p>

<p>The interested and selfish propensities which, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
times of prosperous tranquillity, have such powerful
dominion over the heart, were all expelled, and in
their stead the public virtues, the spirit of personal
devotion to the common cause, a contempt of every
danger, in comparison with the subserviency of the
country, had assumed an unlimited control.</p>

<p>The passion for the public had absorbed all the rest,
as the glorious luminary of heaven extinguishes, in
a flood of refulgence, the twinkling splendor of every
inferior planet. Those of you, my countrymen, who
were actors in those interesting scenes will best know
how feeble and impotent is the language of this
description, to express the impassioned emotions of
the soul with which you were then agitated.</p>

<p>Yet it were injustice to conclude from thence, or
from the greater prevalence of private and personal
motives in these days of calm serenity, that your
sons have degenerated from the virtues of their
fathers. Let it rather be a subject of pleasing reflection
to you that the generous and disinterested
energies which you were summoned to display, are
permitted, by the bountiful indulgence of heaven, to
remain latent in the bosoms of your children.</p>

<p>From the present prosperous appearance of our
public affairs, we may admit a rational hope that our
country will have no occasion to require of us those
extraordinary and heroic exertions, which it was your
fortune to exhibit.</p>

<p>But from the common versatility of all human destiny,
should the prospect hereafter darken, and the
clouds of public misfortune thicken to a tempest;
should the voice of our country’s calamity ever call
us to her relief, we swear, by the precious memory
of the sages who toiled and of the heroes who bled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
in her defense, that we will prove ourselves not unworthy
of the prize which they so dearly purchased;
that we will act as the faithful disciples of those who
so magnanimously taught us the instructive lesson of
republican virtue.</p>

<h4>EXTRACT FROM ADDRESS OF JOHN LATHROP (JULY 4, 1796)</h4>

<p class="center smaller">(At Boston.)</p>

<p>In the war for independence America had but one
object in view, for in independence are concentrated
and condensed every blessing that makes life desirable,
every right and privilege which can tend to the
happiness, or secure the native dignity, of man. In the
attainment of independence were all their passions,
their desires, and their powers engaged. The intrepidity
and magnanimity of their armies, the wisdom
and inflexible firmness of their Congress, the ardency
of their patriotism, their unrepining patience when
assailed by dangers and perplexed with aggravated
misfortune, have long and deservedly employed the
pen of panegyric and the tongue of oratory.</p>

<p>Through the whole Revolutionary conflict a consistency
and systematic regularity were preserved,
equally honorable as extraordinary. The unity of design
and classically correct arrangement of the series
of incidents which completed the epic story of American
independence, were so wonderful, so well wrought,
that political Hypercriticism was abashed at the
mighty production, and forced to join her sister, Envy,
in applauding the glorious composition.</p>

<p>On the last page of Fate’s eventful volume, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the raptured ken of prophecy, I behold Columbia’s
name recorded, her future honors and happiness inscribed.
In the same important book, the approaching
end of tyranny and the triumph of right and justice
are written, in indelible characters. The struggle
will soon be over; the tottering thrones of despots will
quickly fall, and bury their proud incumbents in their
massy ruins.</p>

<h3>OUR NATIONAL ANNIVERSARY</h3>

<p class="author">BY A. H. RICE</p>

<p>We celebrate to-day no idle tradition—the deeds
of no fabulous race; for we tread in the scarcely obliterated
footsteps of an earnest and valiant generation
of men, who dared to stake life, and fortune,
and sacred honor, upon a declaration of rights, whose
promulgation shook tyrants on their thrones, gave
hope to fainting freedom, and reformed the political
ethics of the world.</p>

<p>The greatest heroes of former days have sought
renown in schemes of conquest, based on the love of
dominion or the thirst for war; and such had been
the worship of power in the minds of men, that adulation
had ever followed in the wake of victory. How
daring then the trial of an issue between a handful
of oppressed and outlawed colonists, basing their
cause, under God, upon an appeal to the justice of
mankind and their own few valiant arms. And how
immeasurably great was he, the fearless commander,
who, after the fortunes and triumph of battle were
over, scorned the thought of a regal throne in the
hearts of his countrymen. Amidst the rejoicings of
this day, let us mingle something of gratitude with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
our joy—something of reverence with our gratitude—and
something of duty with our reverence.</p>

<p>Let us cultivate personal independence in the spirit
of loyalty to the State, and may God grant that we
may always be able to maintain the sovereignty of
the State in the spirit of integrity to the Union.</p>

<p>Whatever shall be the fate of other governments,
ours thus sustained, shall stand forever. As has been
elsewhere said, nation after nation may rise and
fall, kingdoms and empires crumble into ruin, but our
own native land, gathering energy and strength from
the lapse of time, shall go on and still go on its destined
way to greatness and renown. And when
thrones shall crumble into dust, when scepters and
diadems shall have been forgotten, till heaven’s last
thunder shall shake the world below, the flag of the
Republic shall still wave on, and its Stars, its Stripes,
and its Eagle, shall still float in pride, and strength,
and glory,</p>

<h3>AMERICA’S NATAL DAY</h3>

<p class="author">BY JAMES GILLESPIE BLAINE</p>

<p>The United States is the only country with a known
birthday. All the rest began, they know not when,
and grew into power, they know not how. If there
had been no Independence Day, England and America
combined would not be so great as each actually is.
There is no “Republican,” no “Democrat,” on the
Fourth of July,—all are Americans. All feel that
their country is greater than party.</p>

<h3>CRISES OF NATIONS</h3>

<p class="author">BY DR. FOSS</p>

<p>There are brief crises in which the drift of individual
and national history is determined, sometimes
unexpectedly; critical moments on which great
decisions hang; days which, like a mountain in a
plain, lift themselves above the dead level of common
days into everlasting eminence. Our Day of Independence
was such a day; so was the day of Marathon,
and the day of Waterloo. Napoleon admitted that
the Austrians fought grandly on the field of Rivoli,
and said, “They failed because they do not understand
the value of minutes.” Humboldt refers the
discovery of America to “a wonderful concatenation
of trivial circumstances,” including a flight of parrots.</p>

<h3>THE FOURTH OF JULY IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY</h3>

<p class="author">BY PHILLIPS BROOKS (JULY 4, 1880)</p>

<p>To all true men the birthday of a nation must always
be a sacred thing. For in our modern thought
the nation is the making-place of man. Not by the
traditions of its history, nor by the splendor of its
corporate achievements, nor by the abstract excellence
of its Constitution, but by its fitness to make men,
to beget and educate human character, to contribute
to the complete humanity the perfect man that is to
be,—by this alone each nation must be judged to-day.
The nations are the golden candlesticks which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
hold aloft the glory of the Lord. No candlestick can
be so rich or venerable that men shall honor it if it
hold no candle. “Show us your man,” land cried to
land.</p>

<p>It is not for me to glorify to-night the country
which I love with all my heart and soul. I may not
ask your praise for anything admirable which the
United States has been or done. But on my country’s
birthday I may do something far more solemn
and more worthy of the hour. I may ask for your
prayers in her behalf: that on the manifold and
wondrous chance which God is giving her,—on her
freedom (for she is free, since the old stain of
slavery was washed out in blood); on her unconstrained
religious life; on her passion for education
and her eager search for truth; on her zealous care for
the poor man’s rights and opportunities; on her
quiet homes where the future generations of men are
growing; on her manufactories and her commerce; on
her wide gates open to the east and to the west; on her
strange meeting of the races out of which a new race
is slowly being born; on her vast enterprise and her
illimitable hopefulness,—on all these materials and
machineries of manhood, on all that the life of my
country must mean for humanity, I may ask you to
pray that the blessing of God, the Father of man, and
Christ, the Son of man, may rest forever.</p>

<h3>AMERICA RESENTS BRITISH DICTATION</h3>

<p class="author">BY HENRY B. CARRINGTON</p>

<p class="center smaller">(From <i>The Patriotic Reader</i>, J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., Phila.)</p>

<p>During the agitation of 1765, concerning the British
Stamp Act, a convention of its opponents was assembled
in New York City under the name of “The
Stamp Act Congress.” Among the most conspicuous
of the delegates from the Massachusetts Colony was
James Otis. As early as 1761 he protested so earnestly
against permitting the British officers of the customs to
have “writs of assistance” in their enforcement of the
British revenue laws, that John Adams, who listened
to his argument, thus described it:</p>

<p>“Otis was a flame of fire! With a promptitude of
classical allusions, a depth of research, a rapid summary
of historical events and dates, a profusion of
legal authorities, a prophetic glance of his eye into
futurity, and a rapid torrent of impetuous eloquence,
he hurried away all before him. Every man of an
immense audience appeared to me to go away, as I did,
ready to take up arms against any ‘writs of assistance.’”</p>

<p>The all-absorbing sentiment of his life, the wealth of
his diction, and the fire of his oratory have been embodied
in a form which stands among the best of
American classics. In the romance of “The Rebels,”
Miss Lydia Maria Francis (afterwards Mrs. Child)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
introduces James Otis as a leading character. After
the opening statement, that “there was hurrying to and
fro through the streets of Boston on the night of the
14th of August, 1765,” his patriotic American woman
shows such a right conception of the power and oratory
of Otis, as well as of the actual tone and spirit
of his times, that the fragments of her hero’s conversation
during the story, gathered in the form of a
speech, have often been mistaken for some actual
appeal to the people of his period. The youth of
America will do well to keep it fresh in mind, and
thereby honor both its author and its subject.</p>

<h3>SPEECH OF JAMES OTIS IN 1765</h3>

<p>England may as well dam up the waters of the
Nile with bulrushes as to fetter the steps of Freedom,
more proud and firm in this youthful land than where
she treads the sequestered glens of Scotland or couches
herself among the magnificent mountains of Switzerland.
Arbitrary principles, like those against which
we now contend, have cost one king of England his
life, another his crown, and they may yet cost a third
his most flourishing colonies.</p>

<p>We are two millions, one-fifth fighting-men. We
are bold and vigorous, and we call no man master.
To the nation from whom we are proud to derive our
origin we ever were, and we ever will be, ready to
yield unforced assistance; but it must not, and it never
can be extorted.</p>

<p>Some have sneeringly asked, Are the Americans
too poor to pay a few pounds on stamped paper?
No! America, thanks to God and herself, is rich.
But the right to take ten pounds implies the right to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
take a thousand; and what must be the wealth that
avarice, aided by power, cannot exhaust? True, the
specter is now small; but the shadow he casts before
him is huge enough to darken all this fair land.</p>

<p>Others, in sentimental style, talk of the immense
debt of gratitude which we owe to England. And
what is the amount of this debt? Why, truly, it is the
same that the young lion owes to the dam which has
brought it forth on the solitude of the mountain, or
left it amid the winds and storms of the desert.</p>

<p>We plunged into the wave, with the great charter
of freedom in our teeth, because the fagot and
torch were behind us. We have waked this new world
from its savage lethargy; forests have been prostrated
in our path; towns and cities have grown up
suddenly as the flowers of the tropics; and the fires
in our autumnal woods are scarcely more rapid than
the increase of our wealth and population.</p>

<p>And do we owe all this to the kind succor of the
mother-country? No; we owe it to the tyranny that
drove us from her; to the pelting storms which invigorated
our helpless infancy!</p>

<p>But perhaps others will say, We ask no money
from your gratitude; we only demand that you should
pay your own expenses. And who, I pray, is to
judge of their necessity? Why, the king! (And,
with all due reverence to his sacred majesty, he understands
the real wants of his distant subjects as
little as he does the language of the Choctaws.) Who
is to judge concerning the frequency of these demands?
The ministry. Who is to judge whether the money is
properly expended? The cabinet behind the throne.</p>

<p>In every instance, those who take are to judge
for those who pay. If this system is suffered to go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
into operation, we shall have reason to esteem it a
great privilege that rain and dew do not depend upon
Parliament; otherwise, they would soon be taxed and
dried.</p>

<p>But, thanks to God! There is freedom enough
left upon earth to resist such monstrous injustice.
The flame of liberty is extinguished in Greece and
Rome, but the light of its glowing embers is still bright
and strong on the shores of America. Actuated by
its sacred influence, we will resist unto death.</p>

<p>But we will not countenance anarchy and misrule.
The wrongs that a desperate community have heaped
upon their enemies shall be amply and speedily repaired.
Still, it is lighted in these colonies which one
breath of their king may kindle into such fury that
the blood of all England cannot extinguish it.</p>

<h3>INDEPENDENCE A SOLEMN DUTY</h3>

<p class="author">BY RICHARD HENRY LEE</p>

<p>The time will certainly come when the fated separation
between the mother-country and these colonies
must take place, whether you will or no, for it is so
decreed by the very nature of things, by the progressive
increase of our population, the fertility of our
soil, the extent of our territory, the industry of our
countrymen, and the immensity of the ocean which
separates the two countries. And if this be true, as it
is most true, who does not see that the sooner it
takes place the better?—that it would be the height
of folly not to seize the present occasion, when British
injustice has filled all hearts with indignation, inspired
all minds with courage, united all opinions in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
one, and put arms in every hand? And how long must
we traverse three thousand miles of a stormy sea to
solicit of arrogant and insolent men either counsel,
or commands to regulate our domestic affairs? From
what we have already achieved it is easy to presume
what we shall hereafter accomplish. Experience is
the source of sage counsels, and liberty is the mother
of great men. Have you not seen the enemy driven
from Lexington by citizens armed and assembled in
one day? Already their most celebrated generals have
yielded in Boston to the skill of ours. Already their
seamen, repulsed from our coasts, wander over the
ocean, the sport of tempests and the prey of famine.
Let us hail the favorable omen, and fight, not for the
sake of knowing on what terms we are to be the
slaves of England, but to secure to ourselves a free
existence, to found a just and independent government.</p>

<p>Why do we longer delay? why still deliberate? Let
this most happy day give birth to the American Republic.
Let her arise, not to devastate and conquer, but to
reëstablish the reign of peace and the laws. The eyes
of Europe are fixed upon us; she demands of us a living
example of freedom that may contrast, by the felicity
of her citizens, with the ever-increasing tyranny which
desolates her polluted shores. She invites us to prepare
an asylum where the unhappy may find solace and
the persecuted repose. She entreats us to cultivate a
propitious soil, where that generous plant which first
sprang up and grew in England, but is now withered
by the poisonous blasts of Scottish tyranny, may revive
and flourish, sheltering under its salubrious and
interminable shade all the unfortunate of the human
race. This is the end presaged by so many omens;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
by our first victories; by the present ardor and union;
by the flight of Howe, and the pestilence which broke
out among Dunmore’s people; by the very winds which
baffled the enemy’s fleets and transports, and that
terrible tempest which engulfed seven hundred vessels
upon the coast of Newfoundland.</p>

<p>If we are not this day wanting in our duty to our
country, the names of the American legislators will
be placed, by posterity, at the side of those of Theseus,
of Lycurgus, of Romulus, of Numa, of the three
Williams of Nassau, and of all those whose memory
has been and will be forever dear to virtuous men and
good citizens.</p>

<h3>AN APPEAL FOR AMERICA</h3>

<p class="author">BY WILLIAM PITT (LORD CHATHAM)</p>

<p class="center smaller">(In Parliament, January 20, 1775)</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>My Lords</i>:</p>

<p>These papers, brought to your table at so late a
period of this business, tell us what? Why, what all
the world knew before: that the Americans, irritated
by repeated injuries, and stripped of their inborn rights
and dearest privileges, have resisted, and entered into
associations for the preservation of their common
liberties.</p>

<p>Had the early situation of the people of Boston been
attended to, things would not have come to this. But
the infant complaints of Boston were literally treated
like the capricious squalls of a child, who, it is said,
did not know whether it was aggrieved or not.</p>

<p>But full well I knew, at that time, that this child, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
not redressed, would soon assume the courage and
voice of a man. Full well I knew that the sons of
ancestors, born under the same free constitution and
once breathing the same liberal air as Englishmen,
would resist upon the same principles and on the same
occasions.</p>

<p>What has government done? They have sent an
armed force consisting of seventeen thousand men, to
dragoon the Bostonians into what is called their duty;
and, so far from once turning their eyes to the policy
and destructive consequence of this scheme, are constantly
sending out more troops. And we are told, in
the language of menace, that if seventeen thousand
men won’t do, fifty thousand shall.</p>

<p>It is true, my lords, with this force they may ravage
the country, waste and destroy as they march; but, in
the progress of fifteen hundred miles, can they occupy
the places they have passed? Will not a country which
can produce three millions of people, wronged and
insulted as they are, start up like hydras in every
corner, and gather fresh strength from fresh opposition?</p>

<p>Nay, what dependence can you have upon the
soldiery, the unhappy engines of your wrath? They
are Englishmen, who must feel for the privileges of
Englishmen. Do you think that these men can turn
their arms against their brethren? Surely no. A victory
must be to them a defeat, and carnage a sacrifice.</p>

<p>But it is not merely three millions of people, the
produce of America, we have to contend with in this
unnatural struggle; many more are on their side, dispersed
over the face of this wide empire. Every Whig
in this country and in Ireland is with them.</p>

<p>In this alarming crisis I come with this paper in my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
hand to offer you the best of my experience and advice;
which is, that a humble petition be presented to his
Majesty, beseeching him that, in order to open the way
toward a happy settlement of the dangerous troubles in
America, it may graciously please him that immediate
orders be given to General Gage for removing his
Majesty’s force from the town of Boston.</p>

<p>Such conduct will convince America that you mean
to try her cause in the spirit of freedom and inquiry,
and not in letters of blood.</p>

<p>There is no time to be lost. Every hour is big with
danger. Perhaps, while I am now speaking, the decisive
blow is struck which may involve millions in the
consequence. And, believe me, the very first drop of
blood which is shed will cause a wound which may
never be healed.</p>

<p>When your lordships look at the papers transmitted
to us from America, when you consider their firmness,
decency, and wisdom, you cannot but respect their
cause and wish to make it your own. For myself, I
must affirm, declare, and avow that, in all my reading
and observation (and it has been my favorite study,
for I have read Thucydides, and have studied and
admired the master-states of the world), I say, I must
declare that, for solidity of reasoning, force of sagacity,
and wisdom of conclusion, under such a complication
of difficult circumstances, no nation or body of men
can stand in preference to the General Congress at
Philadelphia. I trust it is obvious to your lordships
that all attempts to impose servitude upon such men, to
establish despotism, over such a mighty continental
nation, must be vain, must be fatal.</p>

<p>We shall be forced, ultimately, to retract. Let us
retract while we can, not when we must. I say we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
must necessarily undo these violent, oppressive acts.
They Must be repealed. You Will repeal them. I
pledge myself for it that you will, in the end, repeal
them. I stake my reputation on it. I will consent to
be taken for an idiot if they are not finally repealed.</p>

<h3>CONCILIATION OR WAR</h3>

<p class="center">EDMUND BURKE, IN PARLIAMENT, MARCH 22, 1775</p>

<p>We are called again, as it were by a superior warning
voice, to attend to America, and to review the subject
with an unusual degree of calmness. Surely, it is
an awful subject, or there is none this side the grave.
The proposition is peace; not peace hunted through the
medium of war, but peace sought in its natural course,
in its ordinary haunts, and laid in principles purely
pacific. I propose to restore the former unsuspecting
confidence of the colonies in the mother-country, and
reconcile them each to each. My hold of the colonies
is in the close affection which grows from common
names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges
and equal protection. These are ties which, though
light as air, are as strong as links of iron.</p>

<p>Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil
rights associated with your government; they will
cling and grapple to you, and no force under heaven
will be of power to tear them from their allegiance.
But let it once be understood that your government
may be one thing and their privileges another; that
these two things may exist without any mutual relation;
and the cement is gone, the cohesion is loosened,
and everything hastens to decay and dissolution.</p>

<p>As long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty,
the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith,
wherever the chosen race and sons of England worship
freedom, they will turn their faces towards you.
The more they multiply, the more friends you will
have. The more ardently they love liberty, the more
perfect will be their obedience.</p>

<p>Slavery they can have anywhere. It is a weed that
grows in every soil. They may have it from Spain,
they may have it from Prussia. But until you become
lost to all feelings of your true interest and your national
dignity, freedom they can have from none but
you. This is the commodity of price, of which you
have the monopoly.</p>

<p>This is the true Act of Navigation, which binds to
you the commerce of the colonies, and through them
secures to you the wealth of the world. Deny them
this participation of freedom, and you break that
sole bond which originally made, and must still preserve,
the unity of the empire.</p>

<p>Do not entertain so weak an imagination as that
your registers and your bonds, your affidavits and
your sufferances, your cockets and your clearances,
are what form the great securities of your commerce.
Do not dream that your letters of office, and your instructions,
and your suspending clauses, are the things
that hold together the great contexture of this mysterious
whole.</p>

<p>These things do not make your government, dead
instruments, passive tools as they are; it is the spirit
of the English constitution that gives all their life
and efficacy to them. It is the spirit of the English
constitution which, infused, through the mighty mass,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
pervades, feeds, unites, invigorates, vivifies every part
of the empire, even down to the minutest member.</p>

<p>Is it not the same virtue which does everything for
us here in England? Do you imagine, then, that it is
the land tax which raises your revenue? that it is the
annual vote in the committee of supply which gives
you your army? or that it is the mutiny bill which inspires
it with bravery and discipline?</p>

<p>No! surely no! It is the love of the people, it is
their attachment to their government from the sense of
the deep stake they have in such a glorious institution,
which gives you your army and your navy, and infuses
into both that liberal obedience without which your
army would be a base rabble and your navy nothing
but rotten timber.</p>

<p>All this, I know well enough, will sound wild and
chimerical to the profane herd of those vulgar and
mechanical politicians who have no place among us;
a sort of people who think that nothing exists but
what is gross and material, and who, therefore, far
from being qualified to be directors of the great movement
of empire, are not fit to turn a wheel in the machine.</p>

<p>But to men truly initiated and rightly taught, these
ruling and master principles, which in the opinion of
such men as I have mentioned have no substantial
existence, are, in truth, everything and all in all.
Magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom,
and a great empire and little minds go ill together.
If we are conscious of our situation, and glow
with zeal to fill our place as becomes our station and
ourselves, we ought to auspicate all our public proceedings
on America with the old warning of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
church, <i>Sursum corda!</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> We ought to elevate our
minds to the greatness of that trust to which the order
of Providence has called us.</p>

<p>By adverting to the dignity of this high calling, our
ancestors have turned a savage wilderness into a glorious
empire, and have made the most extensive and the
only honorable conquests, not by destroying, but by
promoting the wealth, the number, the happiness, of
the human race.</p>

<h3>“WAR IS ACTUALLY BEGUN”</h3>

<p class="author">BY PATRICK HENRY</p>

<p class="smaller">(Mr. Henry in the Convention of Delegates of Virginia,
March 23, 1775, urges that the colony be immediately put in
a state of defense.)</p>

<p>This, sir, is no time for ceremony. The question
before the house is one of awful moment to this country.
For my own part, I consider it as nothing less
than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion
to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the
freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we
can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility
which we hold to God and our country.
Should I keep back my opinions at this time through
fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as
guilty of treason towards my country and of an act of
disloyalty towards the majesty of Heaven, which I
revere above all earthly kings.</p>

<p>Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the
illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren
till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of
wise men engaged in a great and arduous struggle for
liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of
those who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear
not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal
salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit
it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to
know the worst, and to provide for it.</p>

<p>I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided,
and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way
of judging of the future but by the past. And, judging
by the past, I wish to know what there has been in
the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten
years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen
have been pleased to solace themselves and the house?
Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has
been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove
a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be
betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourself how this gracious
reception of our petition comports with those warlike
preparations which cover our waters and darken
our land.</p>

<p>Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love
and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so
unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in
to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves,
sir. These are the implements of war and subjugation,
the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask,
sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be
not to force us to submission? Can the gentlemen
assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great
Britain any enemy in this quarter of the world, to call
for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
sir, she has none. They are meant for us; they can
be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind
and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry
have been so long forging.</p>

<p>And what have we to oppose them. Shall we try
argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last
ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the
subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in
every light of which it is capable, but it has been all in
vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?
What terms shall we find which have not
been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you,
sir, deceive ourselves longer.</p>

<p>Sir, we have done everything that could be done to
avert the storm that is now coming on. We have petitioned,
we have remonstrated, we have supplicated, we
have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have
implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical
hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions
have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced
additional violence and insult; our supplications have
been disregarded, and we have been spurned with contempt
from the foot of the throne.</p>

<p>In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond
hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer
any room for hope. If we wish to be free, if we
mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges
for which we have been so long contending, if we
mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in
which we have been so long engaged, and which we
have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the
glorious object of our contest shall be obtained, we
must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
to arms and to the God of hosts is all that is left
us!...</p>

<p>They tell us, sir, that we are weak—unable to cope
with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we
be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next
year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and
when a British guard shall be stationed in every house?
Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction?
Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by
lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive
phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound
us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make
a proper use of those means which the God of nature
hath placed in our power.</p>

<p>Three millions of people armed in the holy cause of
liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess,
are invincible by any force which our enemy can send
against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles
alone. There is a just God who presides over the
destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to
fight our battles for us.</p>

<p>The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the
vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have
no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is
now too late to retire from the contest. There is no
retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains
are forged. Their clanking may be heard on the
plains of Boston! The war is inevitable, and let it
come! I repeat it, sir, let it come!</p>

<p>It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen
may cry peace, peace, but there is no peace. The
war has actually begun! The next gale that sweeps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
from the north will bring to our ears the clash of
resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the
field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that the
gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so
dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the
price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty
God! I know not what course others may take, but
as for me, <i>give me liberty or give me death!</i></p>

<h3>EMANCIPATION FROM BRITISH DEPENDENCE</h3>

<p class="author">BY PHILIP FRENEAU</p>

<p class="hanging">(<i>The following note in explanation of proper names,
etc., in this poem is copied from Duyckinck’s edition
of Freneau.</i>)</p>

<p class="smaller">Note.—Sir James Wallace, Admiral Graves, and Captain
Montague, were British naval officers, employed on our coast.
The <i>Viper</i> and <i>Rose</i> were vessels in the service. Lord Dunmore,
the last royal governor of Virginia, had recently in
April, 1775, removed the public stores from Williamsburg,
and, in conjunction with a party of adherents, supported by
the naval force on the station, was making war on the province.
William Tryon, the last Royal governor of New York,
informed of a resolution of the Continental Congress:
“That it be recommended to the several provincial assemblies
in conventions and councils, or committees of safety, to
arrest and secure every person in their respective colonies
whose going at large may, in their opinion, endanger the
safety of the colony or the liberties of America,” discerning
the signs of the times, took refuge on board the Halifax
packet in the harbor, and left the city in the middle of
October, 1775.</p>

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF THE DECLARATION<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h3>

<p class="author">BY SYDNEY GEORGE FISHER</p>

<p>Besides the semi-independent character of their
political governments, there were other circumstances
which tended to inspire a large part of the colonists
with a strong passion for independence, and led them
to resist with unusual energy the remodeling plans
which England began in 1764.</p>

<p>The sturdy influences of Protestantism and American
life had, however, not so great an effect on that large
body of people called loyalists, whose numbers have
been variously estimated at from one-third to over half
the population. They remained loyal to England, and
were so far from being inspired with a love of independence
that they utterly detested the whole patriot
cause and sacrificed their property and lives in the
effort to stamp out its principles and put in their place
the British empire method of alien control as the best
form of government for America.</p>

<p>Patriot parties have existed in other countries without
the aid of the particular influences which Burke
described. The love of national independence is, in
fact, the most difficult passion to eradicate, as the Irish,
the Poles, and other broken nationalities bear witness.
The desire for independence is natural to all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
vigorous communities, is generally regarded as more
manlike and honorable than dependence, and usually
springs up spontaneously whether in Holland, Switzerland
or America, in spite of the commercial and conservative
influences of loyalism. But, nevertheless, the
influences mentioned by Burke, and several that he
did not mention, had no doubt considerable effect in
creating the patriot party in America and inspiring it
with enthusiasm and energy.</p>

<p>The self-confidence aroused in the colonists by their
success in subduing the wilderness, felling the vast
forests, hunting the wild game and still wilder red men,
has often been given as a cause of the Revolution and
the American love of independence. Eloquence is
easily tempted to enlarge upon such causes, and to
describe in romantic language the hunter and the
woodsman, the farmer in the fresh soil of primeval
forests, the fishermen of the Grand Banks, the merchants
and sailors who traded with the whole world
in defiance of the British navigation laws, and the
crews of the whaling ships that pursued their dangerous
game from the equator to the poles.</p>

<p>The American lawyers, according to Burke, were an
important cause of the Revolution. They were very
numerous in the colonies; law and theories of government
were much read and studied, and the people were
trained to discussion of political rights as well as of
religious doctrine. Burke described in picturesque detail
how, in the South, the ruling class lived scattered
and remote from one another, maintaining themselves
in self-reliant authority on plantations with hundreds
of slaves; and slavery, he said, inspired in the
white master a fierce love of independence for himself
and an undying dread of any form of the bondage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
which his love of gain had inflicted on a weaker
race.</p>

<p>The geographical position of the thirteen contiguous
colonies, so situated that they could easily unite and
act together, and having a population that was increasing
so rapidly that it seemed likely in a few years
to exceed the population of England, was possibly a
more effective cause of the Revolution than any of
those that have been named. The consciousness of
possessing such a vast fertile continent, which within
a few generations would support more than double the
population of little England, furnished a profound encouragement
for theories of independence. People
in England were well aware of this feeling in the colonies,
and Joshua Gee, a popular writer on political
economy in 1738, tried to quiet their fears. Some, he
said, were objecting that “if we encourage the Plantations
they will grow rich and set up for themselves
and cast off the English government”; and he went
on to show that this fear was groundless because the
colonists nearly all lived on the navigable rivers and
bays of America, where the British navy could easily
reach and subdue them. He also attempted to argue
away the advantage of the contiguous situation of
the colonies and described them as split up into a dozen
or more separate provinces, each with its own governor;
and it was inconceivable, he said, that such
diverse communities would be able to unite against
England.</p>

<p>English statesmen, however, saw the danger of
union among the colonies long before the outbreak of
the Revolution; and they shrewdly rejected the plan
of union of the Albany conference of 1754; and in the
Revolution itself a large part of England’s diplomatic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
and military efforts were directed towards breaking up
the easy communication among the colonies.</p>

<p>In modern times England’s colonies have been widely
separated from one another. There has been no large
and rapidly increasing white population on contiguous
territory with ability for union. The dark-skinned
population of India is enormous in numbers, but incapable
of the united action of the Americans of 1776,
and India is not considered a colony but a territory continuously
held by overwhelming military force. Instead
of a colonial population which threatened in a
short time to outnumber her own people, England’s
power and population have, in modern times, grown
far beyond any power or population in her well-scattered
white colonies.</p>

<p>The colonists at the time of the Revolution have
often been described as speaking of England as home
and regarding the mother-country with no little degree
of affection; and while there is no doubt some truth
in this, especially as regards the people who were
loyalists, yet a very large proportion of the colonists
had become totally differentiated from the people of
England. This was the inevitable result of having
lived for over a hundred years in the American environment.
They were no longer Englishmen. They
had become completely Americanized. Certain
classes kept up their connection with England, and
many of the rich planters of the South sent their sons
to England to be educated. But a very large part of
the colonists, especially in the older settled provinces,
like Massachusetts and Virginia, had forgotten England
and were another people.</p>

<p>Instead of speaking, as novelists often describe
them, in a formal archaic way, using quaint phrases of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
old English life, the colonists spoke with mannerisms
and colloquial slang which were peculiarly American.
These peculiarities were ridiculed by Englishmen of
the time and formed part of Grant’s famous speech in
Parliament, the burden of which appears to have been
that the colonists had become entirely different from
English people, and Grant is said to have given imitations
of what he considered their strange speech and
manners. Mrs. Knight, in her <i>Journal of Travel from
Boston to New York</i>, had, many years before the
Revolution, given specimens of this difference; and the
language of the New Englanders which she describes
was certainly not like anything in England.</p>

<p>“Law for me—what in the world brings you here
at this time of night? I never see a woman on the
Rode so Dreadful late in all the days of my versall life.
Who are you? Where are you going?”—Mrs.
Knight’s <i>Journal</i>, p. 23.</p>

<p>In 1775 some one wrote a set of humorous verses,
said to have been the original Yankee Doodle song,
to illustrate the colloquial Americanism of the time.
“Slapping” was used for “large,” as in the phrase
“a slapping stallion.” “Nation” was used for “a
great deal,” as in such a phrase as “only a nation
louder.” “Tarnal” was used for “very.” “I see”
was used for “I saw,” “I come” for “I came,” and
“I hooked it off” in place of “I went away.”</p>

<p>Not only did the patriots feel themselves to be quite
different from Englishmen, but they had a consciousness
of ability and power, the result of having governed
themselves so long in their towns, counties, and provinces,
and of having carried on a commerce of their
own in defiance of the English navigation laws. They
felt that they, not Englishmen, had created the country;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
and they had a resolute intention to develop its
future greatness in their own way without the advice
of aliens across three thousand miles of ocean.</p>

<p>This high confidence, which was a conspicuous motive
in the patriot party, was always ridiculed by the
loyalists as mere bumptiousness and conceit. It was
difficult for a loyalist to understand how any one could
seriously put himself in opposition to the British empire
or want any form of government except the
British constitution. But the patriot estimate of their
own ability was by no means an exaggeration. They
could be overcome, of course, as the Boer republics
and other peoples have been overcome, by the superior
numbers or wealth of Great Britain. But the history of
the Revolution disclosed qualities in which the Americans
notoriously excelled Europeans as well as the
Anglo-Saxon stock in England from which they were
derived. They were of keener practical intelligence,
more promptness in action, more untiring energy, more
originality in enterprise, better courage and endurance,
and more natural military skill among the rank and
file. These distinctively American qualities, we now
call them, seem to have been much more in evidence
among the patriot party than among the loyalists.</p>

<p>Every circumstance of their past and every consideration
of their present convinced the patriot of the
infinite pleasure and value of home rule and they had
codified their opinions into a political philosophy
which not only justified their semi-independence and
disregard of acts of Parliament, but would also justify
them in breaking off from England, at the first opportunity
and becoming absolutely independent. They
had gathered this philosophy from the works of certain
European writers—Grotius, Puffendorf, Locke,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
Burlamaqui, Beccaria, Montesquieu, and others—who
had applied to politics and government the doctrines
of religious liberty and the right of private
judgment which had been developed by the Reformation.
Being such extreme Protestants, and having carried
so far the religious ideas of the Reformation, the
colonists naturally accepted in their fullest meaning the
political principles of the Reformation. If we are
looking for profound influences in the Revolution, it
would be difficult to find any that were stronger than
two of the writers just mentioned, Locke and Burlamaqui,
whose books had a vast effect in the break-up
of the British empire which we are about to record.</p>

<p>Beginning with Grotius, who was born in 1582, and
ending with Montesquieu, who died in 1755, the writers
mentioned covered a period of about two hundred
years of political investigation, thought and experience.
In fact, they covered the period since the Reformation.
They represented the effect of the Reformation
on political thought. They represented also all those
nations whose opinions on such subjects were worth
anything. Grotius was a Dutchman, Puffendorf a
German, Locke an Englishman, Burlamaqui an Italian
Swiss, and Montesquieu a Frenchman.</p>

<p>Hooker, who lived from 1553 to 1600, and whom
Locke cites so freely, might be included in the number,
and that would make the period quite two hundred
years. Hooker, in his “Ecclesiastical Polity,” declared
very emphatically that governments could not be
legitimate unless they rested on the consent of the
governed; and this principle forms the foundation of
Locke’s famous essays.</p>

<p>There were, of course, other minor writers; and the
colonists relied upon them all; but seldom troubled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
themselves to read the works of the earlier ones, or to
read Hutchinson, Clarke and other followers of that
school, because Locke, Burlamaqui, and Beccaria had
summarized them all and brought them down to date.
To this day any one going to the Philadelphia Library,
and asking for No. 77, can take in his hands the identical,
well-worn volume of Burlamaqui which delegates
to the Congress and many an unsettled Philadelphian
read with earnest, anxious minds. It was among the
first books that the library had obtained; and perhaps
the most important and effective book it has ever
owned.</p>

<p>The rebellious colonists also read Locke’s “Two
Treatises on Government” with much profit and satisfaction
to themselves. Locke was an extreme Whig,
an English revolutionist of the school of 1688. Before
that great event, he had been unendurable to the
royalists, who were in power, and had been obliged to
spend a large part of his time on the continent. In
the preface of his “Two Treatises,” he says that they
will show how entirely legitimate is the title of William
III to the throne, because it is established on the consent
of the people. That is the burden of his whole
argument—the consent of the people as the only true
foundation of government. That principle sank so
deep into the minds of the patriot colonists that it was
the foundation of all their political thought, and became
an essentially American idea.</p>

<p>Beccaria, who, like Burlamaqui, was an Italian, also
exercised great influence on the colonists. His famous
book, “Crimes and Punishments,” was also a
short, concise, but very eloquent volume. It caused a
great stir in the world. The translation circulated in
America had added to it a characteristic commentary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
by Voltaire. Beccaria, though not writing directly on
the subject of liberty, necessarily included that subject,
because he dealt with the administration of the criminal
law. His plea for more humane and just punishments,
and for punishments more in proportion to the
offense, found a ready sympathy among the Americans,
who had already revolted in disgust from the
brutality and extravagant cruelty of the English
criminal code.</p>

<p>But Beccaria also stated most beautifully and clearly
the essential principles of liberty. His foundation doctrine,
that “every act of authority of one man over
another for which there is not absolute necessity is
tyrannical,” made a most profound impression in
America. He laid down also the principle that “in
every human society there is an effort continually tending
to confer on one part the highest power and happiness,
and to reduce the other to the extreme of weakness
and misery.” That sentence became the life-long
guide of many Americans. It became a constituent
part of the minds of Jefferson and Hamilton. It can
be seen as the foundation, the connecting strand, running
all through the essays of the <i>Federalist</i>. It was
the inspiration of the “checks and balances” in the
national Constitution. It can be traced in American
thought and legislation down to the present time.</p>

<p>Burlamaqui’s book, devoted exclusively to the subject
of liberty and independence, is still one of the best
expositions of the true doctrines of natural law, or the
rights of man. At the time of the Revolution these
rights of man were often spoken of as our rights as
men, which is a very descriptive phrase, because the
essence of those rights is political manhood, honorable
self-reliance as opposed to degenerate dependence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>Burlamaqui belonged to a Protestant family that
had once lived at Lucca, Italy; but had been compelled,
like the family of Turretini, and many others, to take
refuge in Switzerland. He became a professor at
Geneva, which gave him the reputation of a learned
man. He also became a counselor of state and was
noted for his practical sagacity. He had intended to
write a great work in many volumes on the subject to
which he had devoted so much of his life, “The Principles
of Natural Law,” as it was then called. Ill
health preventing such a huge task, he prepared a
single volume, which he said was only for beginners
and students, because it dealt with the bare elements
of the science in the simplest and plainest language.</p>

<p>This little book was translated into English in 1748,
and contained only three hundred pages; but in that
small space of large, clear type, Burlamaqui compressed
everything that the patriot colonists wanted
to know. He was remarkably clear and concise, and
gave the Americans the qualities of the Italian mind
at its best. He aroused them by his modern glowing
thought and his enthusiasm for progress and
liberty. His handy little volume was vastly more effective
and far-reaching than would have been the
blunderbuss he had intended to load to the muzzle.</p>

<p>If we examine the volumes of Burlamaqui’s predecessors,
Grotius, Puffendorf, and the others, we
find their statements about natural law and our rights
as men rather brief, vague, and general, as is usual
with the old writers on any science. Burlamaqui
brought them down to date, developed their principles,
and swept in the results of all the thought and
criticism since their day.</p>

<p>The term natural law, which all these writers used,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
has long since gone out of fashion. They used it
because, inspired by the Reformation, they were struggling
to get away from the arbitrary system, the
artificial scholasticism, the despotism of the middle
ages. They were seeking to obtain for law and government
a foundation which should grow out of the
nature of things, the common facts of life that everybody
understood. They sought a system that, being
natural, would become established and eternal like
nature; a system that would displace that thing of the
middle ages which they detested, and called “arbitrary
institution.”</p>

<p>Let us, they said, contemplate for a time man as
he is in himself, the natural man, his wants and requirements.</p>

<p>“The only way,” said Burlamaqui, “to attain to
the knowledge of that natural law is to consider attentively
the nature and constitution of man, the relations
he has to the beings that surround him, and
the states from thence resulting. In fact, the very
term of natural law and the notion we have given of
it, show that the principles of this science must
be taken from the very nature and constitution of
man.”</p>

<p>Men naturally, he said, draw together to form
societies for mutual protection and advantage. Their
natural state is a state of union and society, and
these societies are merely for the common advantage
of all of the members.</p>

<p>This was certainly a very simple proposition, but
it had required centuries to bring men’s minds back
to it; and it was not altogether safe to put forth because
it implied that each community existed for the
benefit of itself, for the benefit of its members, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
not for the benefit of a prince or another nation, or
for the church, or for an empire.</p>

<p>It was a principle quickly seized upon by the
Americans as soon as their difficulties began in 1764.
In their early debates and discussions we hear a great
deal about a “state of nature,” which at first seems
rather meaningless to us. But it was merely their
attempt to apply to themselves the fundamental principles
of the Reformation. Were the colonies by the
exactions and remodeling of the mother-country
thrown into that “state of nature,” where they could
reorganize society afresh, on the basis of their own
advantage? How much severity or how much oppression
or dissatisfaction would bring about this
state of nature? Was there any positive rule by
which you could decide? Patrick Henry, who was
always very eloquent on the subject, declared that
the boundary had been passed; that the colonies were
in a state of nature.</p>

<p>Any one who is at all familiar with the trend of
thought for the last hundred years can readily see how
closely this idea of going back to natural causes and
first conceptions for the discovery of political principles
is allied to every kind of modern progress; to
the modern study of natural history, the study of
the plants and animals in their natural environment,
instead of by preconceived scholastic theories; the
study of the human body by dissection instead of by
supposition; the study of heat, light, electricity, the
soil, the rocks, the ocean, the stars by actual observation,
without regard to what the Scriptures and
learned commentators had to say.</p>

<p>A large part of the American colonists were very
far advanced in all the ideas of the Reformation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Burlamaqui’s book, applying to politics and government,
these free and wonderful principles, came to
a large number of them as the most soul-stirring and
mind-arousing message they had ever heard. It has
all become trite enough to us; but to them it was
fresh and marvelous. Their imaginations seized on
it with the indomitable energy and passion which the
climate inspired, and some who breathed the air of
Virginia and Massachusetts were on fire with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“This state of nature,” argued Burlamaqui, “is not
the work of man, but established by divine institution.”</p>

<p>“Natural society is a state of equality and liberty;
a state in which all men enjoy the same prerogatives,
and an entire independence on any other power but
God. For every man is naturally master of himself,
and equal to his fellow-creatures so long as he does
not subject himself to another person’s authority by
a particular convention.”</p>

<p>Here we find coupled with liberty that word equality
which played such a tremendous part in history
for the succeeding hundred years. And we must bear
in mind that what the people of that time meant by
it was political equality, equality of rights, equality
before the law and the government; and not equality
of ability, talents, fortunes, or gifts, as some have
fancied.</p>

<p>Burlamaqui not only found liberty, independence,
and equality growing out of nature itself; but he
argued that all this was part of the divine plan, the
great order of nature and the universe. Indeed, that
was what he and his Reformation predecessors had
set out to discover, to unravel the system of humanity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
to see if there really was a system that could be
gathered from the actual plain facts; and to see also
if there was a unity and completeness in this system.</p>

<p>“The human understanding,” he says, “is naturally
right, and has within itself a strength sufficient to arrive
at the knowledge of truth, and to distinguish it
from error.” That he announces as the fundamental
principle of his book, “the hinge whereon the whole
system of humanity turns,” and it was simply his way
of restating the great doctrine of the Reformation,
the right of private judgment.</p>

<p>But he goes on to enlarge on it in a way particularly
pleasing to the patriot colonists, for he says we have
this power to decide for ourselves, “especially in
things wherein our respective duties are concerned.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the colonists, “we have often thought
that we were the best judges of all our own affairs.”</p>

<p>“Those who feel,” said Franklin, in his examination
before Parliament, “can best judge.”</p>

<p>The daring Burlamaqui went on to show that liberty
instead of being, as some supposed, a privilege to be
graciously accorded, was in reality a universal right,
inherent in the nature of things.</p>

<p>Then appears that idea common to the great leaders
of thought in that age, that man’s true purpose in
the world is the pursuit of happiness. To this pursuit,
they said, every human being has a complete
right. It was part of liberty; a necessary consequence
of liberty. This principle of the right to pursue
happiness, which is merely another way of stating
the right of self-development, has played as great a
part in subsequent history as equality. It is one of
the foundation principles of the Declaration of Independence.
It is given there as the ground-work of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
the right of revolution, the right of a people to throw
off or destroy a power which interferes with this
great pursuit, “and to institute a new government, laying
its foundation on such principles, and organizing
its power in such form as to them shall seem most
likely to effect their safety and happiness.”</p>

<p>It has been interpreted in all sorts of ways—as
the right to improve your condition, to develop your
talents, to grow rich, or to rise into the class of society
above you. It is now in its broadest meaning so
axiomatic in this country that Americans can hardly
realize that it was ever disputed.</p>

<p>But it was, and still is, disputed in England and on
the continent. Even so liberal an Englishman as
Kingsley resented with indignation the charge that he
favored the aspiration of the lower classes to change
their condition. Once a cobbler, remain a cobbler,
and be content to be a good cobbler. In other words,
the righteousness which he so loudly professed was intended
to exalt certain fortunate individuals, and not
to advance society.</p>

<p>This desire and pursuit of happiness being part of
nature, or part of the system of Providence, and as
essential to every man and as inseparable from him
as his reason, it should be freely allowed him, and
not repressed. This, Burlamaqui declares, is a great
principle, “the key of the human system,” opening
to vast consequences for the world.</p>

<p>The consequences have certainly been vaster than
he dreamed of. Millions of people now live their
daily life in the sunshine of this doctrine. Millions
have fled to us from Europe to seek its protection.
Not only the whole American system of laws, but
whole philosophies and codes of conduct have grown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
up under it. The abolitionists appealed to it, and
freed six millions of slaves. The transcendental
philosophy of New England, that extreme and beautiful
attempt to develop conscience, nobility, and character
from within; that call of the great writers like
Lowell to every humble individual to stand by his
own personality, fear it not, advance it by its own
lines; even our education, the elective system of our
colleges—all these things have followed under that
“pursuit of happiness,” which the patriot colonists
seized upon so gladly in 1765 and enshrined in their
Declaration of Independence in 1776.</p>

<p>They found in the principles of natural law how
government, civil society, or “sovereignty,” as those
writers were apt to call it, was to be built up and
regulated. Civil government did not destroy natural
rights and the pursuit of happiness. On the contrary,
it was intended to give those rights greater security
and a fresh force and efficiency. That was the purpose
men had in coming together to form a civil
society for the benefit of all; that was the reason, as
Burlamaqui put it, that “the sovereign became the
depositary, as it were, of the will and strength of each
individual.”</p>

<p>This seemed very satisfactory to some of the colonists.
You choose your sovereign, your government,
for yourself, and make it your mere depositary or
agent. Then as to the nature of the government, the
right to govern, they were very much pleased to find
that the only right there was of this sort was the
right of each community to govern itself. Government
by outside power was absolutely indefensible,
because the notion that there was a divine right in
one set of people to rule over others was exploded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
nonsense, and the assertion that mere might or superior
power necessarily gave such right was equally
indefensible. There remained only one plausible reason,
and that was that superior excellence, wisdom, or
ability might possibly give such right.</p>

<p>As to this “superior excellence” theory, if you
admitted it you denied man’s inherent right to liberty,
equality and the pursuit of happiness; you denied
his moral accountability and responsibility; you crippled
his independent development, his self-development,
his individual action; in a word, you destroyed
the whole natural system.</p>

<p>Because a man is inferior to another is no reason
why he should surrender his liberty, his accountability,
his chance for self-development, to the superior. We
do not surrender our property to the next man who
is richer or an abler business manager. Our inferiority
does not give him a right over us. On the
contrary, the inferiority of the inferior man is an additional
reason why he should cling to all those rights
of nature which have been given to him, that he may
have wherewithal to raise himself, and be alone accountable
for himself. Or, as Burlamaqui briefly
summarized it:</p>

<p>“The knowledge I have of the excellency of a superior
does not alone afford me a motive sufficient to
subject myself to him, and to induce me to abandon
my own will in order to take his for my rule; ...
and without any reproach of conscience I may sincerely
judge that the intelligent principle within me
is sufficient to direct my conduct.”</p>

<p>Only the people, Burlamaqui explained, have inherent
inalienable rights; and they alone can confer
the privilege of commanding. It had been supposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
that the sovereign alone had rights, and the people
only privileges. But here were Burlamaqui, Puffendorf,
Montesquieu, Locke, and fully half the American
colonists, undertaking to reverse this order and
announcing that the people alone had rights, and the
sovereign merely privileges.</p>

<p>These principles the Americans afterwards translated
in their documents by the phrase, “a just government
exists only by consent of the governed.”
All men being born politically equal, the colonies, as
Dickinson and Hamilton explained, are equally with
Great Britain entitled to happiness, equally entitled to
govern themselves, equally entitled to freedom and independence.</p>

<p>It is curious to see the cautious way in which some
of the colonists applied these doctrines by mixing
them up with loyalty arguments. This is very noticeable
in the pamphlets written by Alexander Hamilton.
He gives the stock arguments for redress of grievances,
freedom from internal taxation, government by the
king alone, and will not admit that he is anything
but a loyal subject. At the same time there runs
through all he says an undercurrent of strong rebellion
which leads to his ultimate object. “The power,” he
says, “which one society bestows upon any man or
body of men can never extend beyond its own limits.”
This he lays down as a universal truth, independently
of charters and the wonderful British Constitution.
It applied to the whole world. Parliament was
elected by the people of England, therefore it had no
authority outside of the British isle. That British
isle and America were separate societies.</p>

<p>“Nature,” said Hamilton, “has distributed an
equality of rights to every man.” How then, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
asked, can the English people have any rights over
life, liberty, or property in America? They can have
authority only among themselves in England. We are
separated from Great Britain, Hamilton argued, not
only by the ocean, by geography, but because we have
no part or share in governing her. Therefore, as
we have no share in governing her, she, by the law
of nature, can have no share in governing us; she is
a separate society.</p>

<p>The British, he said, were attempting to involve in
the idea of a colony the idea of political slavery, and
against that a man must fight with his life. To be
controlled by the superior wisdom of another nation
was ridiculous, unworthy of the consideration of manhood;
and at this point he used that sentence which
has so often been quoted—“Deplorable is the condition
of that people who have nothing else than the
wisdom and justice of another to depend upon.”</p>

<p>Charters and documents, he declared, must yield to
natural laws and our rights as men.</p>

<p>“The sacred rights of man are not to be rummaged
for among old parchments or musty records. They
are written as with a sunbeam in the whole volume
of human nature by the hand of divinity itself and
can never be erased by mortal power.”</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence was an epitome
of these doctrines of natural law applied to the colonies.
The Declaration of Independence originated in
these doctrines, and not in the mind of Jefferson, as
so many people have absurdly supposed. In order to
see how directly the Declaration was an outcome of
these teachings we have only to read its opening
paragraphs:</p>

<p>“When, in the course of human events, it becomes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands
which have connected them with another, and to assume,
among the powers of the earth, the separate
and equal station to which the laws of nature and
of nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to
the opinions of mankind requires that they should
declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>

<p>“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal; that they are endowed by
their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
That, to secure these rights, governments are
instituted among men, deriving their just powers from
the consent of the governed; that, whenever any form
of government becomes destructive of these ends, it
is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and
to institute a new government, laying its foundation
on such principles, and organizing its powers in such
form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate
that governments long established should not be
changed for light and transient causes; and, accordingly,
all experience hath shown, that mankind are
more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than
to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which
they are accustomed.”</p>

<p>By understanding the writings of Burlamaqui,
Locke, and Beccaria, which the colonists were studying
so intently, we know the origin of the Declaration,
and need not flounder in the dark, as so many
have done, wondering where it came from, or how it
was that Jefferson could have invented it. Being unwilling
to take the trouble of examining carefully the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
influences which preceded the Declaration, historical
students are sometimes surprised to find a document
like the Virginia Bill of Rights or the supposed
Mecklenburg resolutions, issued before the Declaration
and yet containing the same principles. They instantly
jump to the conclusion that here is the real
origin and author of the Declaration, and from this
Jefferson stole his ideas.</p>

<p>Jefferson merely drafted the Declaration. Neither
he, Adams, Franklin, Sherman, nor Livingston, who
composed the committee which was responsible for it,
ever claimed any originality for its principles. They
were merely stating principles which were already
familiar to the people, which had been debated over
and over again in Congress; which were so familiar
in fact, that they stated them rather carelessly and
took too much for granted. It would have been better,
instead of saying, “all men are created equal,”
to have said that all men are created politically equal,
which was what they meant, and what every one at
that time understood. By leaving out the word “politically”
they gave an opportunity to a generation
unfamiliar with the doctrines of natural law to suppose
that they meant that all men are created, or
should be made, equal in conditions, opportunities or
talents.</p>

<h3>THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</h3>

<p class="author">BY JOHN D. LONG</p>

<p>Recall the quaint and homely city of Philadelphia,
the gloom that hung over it from the terrible responsibility
of the step there taken, the modest hall still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
standing and baptized as the Cradle of Liberty. On
its tower swung the bell which yet survives with its
legend,—“Proclaim liberty throughout all the world
to all the inhabitants thereof.” That day it rang out
a proclamation of liberty that will indeed echo round
the world and in the ears of all the inhabitants thereof
long after the bell itself shall have crumbled into
dust.</p>

<p>Hancock is in the president’s chair; before him sit
the half-hundred delegates who at that time represent
America. Among the names it is remarkable
how many there are that have since been famous in
our annals. The committee appointed to draft the
declarations are Jefferson, youngest and tallest; John
Adams; Sherman, shoemaker; Franklin, printer; and
Robert R. Livingston. If the patriot, Samuel Adams,
at the sunrise of Lexington could say,—“Oh, what
a glorious morning!” how well might he have renewed
in the more brilliant noontime of July 4, 1776,
the same prophetic words!</p>

<p>There is nothing in the prophecies of old more
striking and impressive than the words of John Adams,
who declared the event would be celebrated by succeeding
generations as a great anniversary festival
and commemorated as a day of deliverance, from one
end of the continent to the other; that through all
the gloom he could see the light; that the end was
worth all the means and that posterity would triumph
in the transaction. I am not of those who overrate
the past. I know that the men of 1776 had the common
weaknesses and shortcomings of humanity. I
read the Declaration of Independence with no feeling
of awe; and yet if I were called upon to select
from the history of the world any crisis grander,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
loftier, purer, more heroic, I should not know where
to turn.</p>

<p>It seems simple enough to-day, but it was something
else in that day. The men who signed the
Declaration knew not but they were signing warrants
for their own ignominious execution on the gibbet.
The bloody victims of the Jacobite rebellions of 1715
and 1745 were still a warning to rebels; and the gory
holocaust of Culloden was fresh in the memory. But
it was not only the personal risk; it was risking the
homes, the commerce, the lives, the property, the
honor, the future destiny of three million innocent
people,—men, women, and children. It was defying
on behalf of a straggling chain of colonies clinging
to the sea-board, the most imperial power of the world.
It was, more than all, like Columbus sailing into
awful uncertainty of untried space, casting off from
an established and familiar form of government and
politics, drifting away to unknown methods, and upon
the dangerous and yawning chaos of democratic institutions,
flying from ills they had to those they knew
not of, and perhaps laying the way for a miserable
and bloody catastrophe in anarchy and riot.</p>

<p>There are times when ordinary men are borne by
the tide of an occasion to crests of grandeur in conduct
and action. Such a time, such an occasion, was
that of the Declaration. While the signers were
picked men, none the less true is it that their extraordinary
fame is due not more to their merits than to
the crisis at which they were at the helm and to the
great popular instinct which they obeyed and expressed.
And why do we commemorate with such
veneration and display this special epoch and event in
our history? Why do we repeat the words our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
fathers spoke or wrote? Why cherish their names,
when our civilization is better than theirs and when
we have reached in science, art, education, religion,
politics, in every phase of human development, even in
morals, a higher level?</p>

<p>It is because we recognize that in their beginnings
the eternal elements of truth and right and justice
were conspicuous. To those eternal verities we pay
our tribute, and not to their surroundings, except so
far as we let the form stand for the spirit, the man
for the idea, the event for the purpose. And it is
also because we can do no better work than to perpetuate
virtue in the citizen by keeping always fresh
in the popular mind the great heroic deeds and times
of our history. The valuable thing in the past is not
the man or the events,—which are both always
ordinary and which under the enchantment of distance
and the pride of descent, we love to surround
with exaggerated glory,—it is rather in the sentiment
for which the man and the event stand. The
ideal is alone substantial and alone survives.</p>

<h3>THE SIGNING OF THE DECLARATION</h3>

<p class="author">BY GEORGE LIPPARD</p>

<p>It is a cloudless summer day; a clear blue sky
arches and expands above a quaint edifice rising among
the giant trees in the center of a wide city. That
edifice is built of plain red brick, with heavy window
frames, and a massive hall door.</p>

<p>Such is the State House of Philadelphia in the year
of our Lord 1776.</p>

<p>In yonder wooden steeple, which crowns the summit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
of that red brick State House, stands an old man with
snow-white hair and sunburnt face. He is clad in
humble attire, yet his eye gleams as it is fixed on
the ponderous outline of the bell suspended in the
steeple there. By his side, gazing into his sunburnt
face in wonder, stands a flaxen-haired boy, with laughing
eyes of summer blue. The old man ponders for
a moment upon the strange words written upon the
bell, then, gathering the boy in his arms, he speaks:
“Look here, my child; will you do this old man a
kindness? Then hasten down the stairs, and wait in
the hall below till a man gives you a message for
me; when he gives you that word, run out into the
street and shout it up to me. Do you mind?” The
boy sprang from the old man’s arms and threaded his
way down the dark stairs.</p>

<p>Many minutes passed. The old bell-keeper was
alone. “Ah!” groaned the old man, “he has forgotten
me.” As the word was upon his lips a merry,
ringing laugh broke on his ear. And there, among
the crowd on the pavement, stood the blue-eyed boy,
clapping his tiny hands while the breeze blew his flaxen
hair all about his face, and, swelling his little chest,
he raised himself on tiptoe, and shouted the single
word, “Ring!”</p>

<p>Do you see that old man’s eye fire? Do you see
that arm so suddenly bared to the shoulder? Do you
see that withered hand grasping the iron tongue of
the bell? That old man is young again. His veins
are filling with a new life. Backward and forward,
with sturdy strokes, he swings the tongue. The bell
peals out; the crowds in the street hear it, and burst
forth in one long shout. Old Delaware hears it, and
gives it back on the cheers of her thousand sailors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
The city hears it, and starts up from desk and workshop,
as if an earthquake had spoken.</p>

<p>Under that very bell, pealing out at noonday, in an
old hall, fifty-six traders, farmers and mechanics had
assembled to break the shackles of the world. The
committee, who had been out all night, are about to
appear. At last the door opens, and they advance to
the front. The parchment is laid on the table. Shall
it be signed or not? Then ensues a high and stormy
debate. Then the faint-hearted cringe in corners.
Then Thomas Jefferson speaks his few bold words,
and John Adams pours out his whole soul.</p>

<p>Still there is a doubt; and that pale-faced man,
rising in one corner, speaks out something about
“axes, scaffolds, and a gibbet.” A tall, slender man
rises, and his dark eye burns, while his words ring
through the halls: “Gibbets! They may stretch our
necks on every scaffold in the land. They may turn
every rock into a gibbet, every tree into a gallows;
and yet the words written on that parchment can
never die. They may pour out our blood on a thousand
altars, and yet, from every drop that dyes the
axe, or drips on the sawdust of the block, a new
martyr to freedom will spring into existence. What!
are there shrinking hearts and faltering voices here,
when the very dead upon our battle-fields arise and
call upon us to sign that parchment, or be accursed
forever?</p>

<p>“Sign! if the next moment the gibbet’s rope is
around your neck. Sign! if the next moment this
hall rings with the echo of the falling axe. Sign! by
all your hopes in life or death, as husbands, as fathers,
as men! Sign your names to that parchment.</p>

<p>“Yes! were my soul trembling on the verge of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
eternity; were this voice choking in the last struggle,
I would still, with the last impulse of that soul,
with the last gasp of that voice, implore you to remember
this truth: God has given America to the
free. Yes! as I sink down in the gloomy shadow of
the grave, with my last breath I would beg of you
sign that parchment.”</p>

<h3>SUPPOSED SPEECH OF JOHN ADAMS</h3>

<p class="author">BY DANIEL WEBSTER</p>

<p>Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I
give my hand and my heart to this vote. It is true,
indeed, that in the beginning we aimed not at independence.
But there is a Divinity which shapes our
ends. The injustice of England has driven us to
arms; and, blinded to her own interest and our good
she has obstinately persisted, till independence is now
within our grasp. We have but to reach forth to it,
and it is ours. Why, then, should we defer the Declaration?
Is any man so weak as now to hope for a
reconciliation with England, which shall leave neither
safety to the country and its liberties, nor safety to
his life and his own honor? Are you not, sir, who
sit in that chair, is not he, our venerable colleague
near you, are you not both already the proscribed and
predestined objects of punishment and of vengeance?
Cut off from all hope of royal clemency, what are
you, what can you be, while the power of England
remains, but outlaws?</p>

<p>If we postpone independence, do we mean to carry
on or give up the war? Do we mean to submit to
the measures of Parliament, Boston Port-Bill and all?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
Do we mean to submit, and consent that we ourselves
shall be ground to powder, and our country and its
rights, trodden down in the dust? I know we do not
mean to submit. We never shall submit. Do we
mean to violate that most solemn obligation ever entered
into by men, that plighting before God, of our
sacred honor to Washington, when, putting him forth
to incur the dangers of war, as well as the political
hazards of the times, we promised to adhere to him,
in every extremity, with our fortunes and our lives?
I know there is not a man here, who would not rather
see a general conflagration sweep over the land, or
an earthquake sink it, than one jot or tittle of that
plighted faith fall to the ground. For myself, having,
twelve months ago, in this place, moved you, that
George Washington be appointed commander of the
forces raised, or to be raised, for defense of American
liberty, may my right hand forget her cunning,
and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if
I hesitate or waver in the support I give him.</p>

<p>The war, then, must go on. We must fight it
through. And if the war must go on, why put off
longer the Declaration of Independence? That
measure will strengthen us. It will give us character
abroad. The nations will then treat with us, which
they never can do while we acknowledge ourselves subjects
in arms against our sovereign. Nay, I maintain
that England herself will sooner treat for peace with
us on the footing of independence than consent, by repealing
her Acts, to acknowledge that her whole conduct
toward us has been a course of injustice and
oppression. Her pride will be less wounded by submitting
to that course of things which now predestinates
our independence than by yielding the points in controversy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
to her rebellious subjects. The former she
would regard as the result of fortune; the latter she
would feel as her own deep disgrace. Why, then,
why, then, sir, do we not as soon as possible change
this from a civil to a national war? And, since we
must fight it through, why not put ourselves in a state
to enjoy all the benefits of victory, if we gain the
victory?</p>

<p>If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But we shall
not fail. The cause will raise up armies; the cause
will create navies. The people, the people, if we are
true to them, will carry us, and will carry themselves,
gloriously through the struggle. I care not how fickle
other people have been found. I know the people
of these Colonies, and I know that resistance to
British aggression is deep and settled in their hearts,
and cannot be eradicated. Every Colony, indeed, has
expressed its willingness to follow, if we but take
the lead.</p>

<p>Sir, the Declaration will inspire the people with increased
courage. Instead of a long and bloody war
for restoration of privileges, for redress of grievances,
for chartered immunities, held under a British
King, set before them the gloriousness of entire independence,
and it will breathe into them anew the
breath of life. Read this Declaration at the head of
the army; every sword will be drawn from its scabbard,
and the solemn vow uttered to maintain it, or to
perish on the bed of honor. Publish it from the
pulpit; religion will approve it, and the love of religious
liberty will cling round it, resolved to stand
with it, or fall with it. Send it to the public halls;
proclaim it there; let them hear it who heard the first
roar of the enemy’s cannon; let them see it who saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
their brothers and their sons fall on the field of
Bunker Hill, and in the streets of Lexington and
Concord, and the very walls will cry out in its support.</p>

<p>Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs, but
I see, I see clearly, through this day’s business. You
and I, indeed, may rue it. We may not live to the
time when this Declaration shall be made good. We
may die; die, colonists; die, slaves; die, it may be,
ignominiously and on the scaffold. Be it so; be it so!
If it be the pleasure of heaven that my country shall
require the poor offering of my life, the victim shall
be ready at the appointed hour of sacrifice, come
when that hour may. But, while I do live, let me
have a country, or at least, the hope of a country, and
that a free country.</p>

<p>But whatever may be our fate, be assured, be assured
that this Declaration will stand. It may cost treasure,
and it may cost blood, but it will stand, and it will
richly compensate for both. Through the thick gloom
of the present, I see the brightness of the future, as
the sun in heaven. We shall make this a glorious,
an immortal day. When we are in our graves, our
children will honor it. They will celebrate it with
thanksgiving, with festivity, with bonfires and illuminations.
On its annual return, they will shed tears,
copious, gushing tears, not of subjection and slavery,
not of agony and distress, but of exultation, of gratitude
and of joy. Sir, before God, I believe the hour
is come. My judgment approves this measure, and
my whole heart is in it. All that I have, and all that
I am, and all that I hope, in this life, I am now ready
here to stake upon it. And I leave off as I began,
that, live or die, survive or perish, I am for the Declaration.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
It is my living sentiment, and by the blessing
of God it shall be my dying sentiment, Independence
<i>now</i>, and INDEPENDENCE FOREVER!</p>

<h3>THE LIBERTY BELL</h3>

<p class="author">BY J. T. HEADLEY</p>

<p>On July fourth, 1776, the representatives of the
American people gathered at the State House in Philadelphia
to take final action upon the Declaration of
Independence, which had been under discussion for
three days.</p>

<p>It was soon known throughout the city; and in the
morning, before Congress assembled, the streets were
filled with excited men, some gathered in groups engaged
in eager discussion, and others moving toward
the State House. All business was forgotten in the
momentous crisis which the country had now reached.
No sooner had the members taken their seats than the
multitude gathered in a dense mass around the entrance.
The bell-man mounted to the belfry, to be
ready to proclaim the joyful tidings of freedom as
soon as the final vote was passed. A bright-eyed boy
was stationed below to give the signal.</p>

<p>Around the bell, brought from England, had been
cast, more than twenty years before, the prophetic
motto: “Proclaim liberty throughout all the land,
unto all the inhabitants thereof.” Although its loud
clang had often sounded over the city, the proclamation
engraved on its iron lip had never yet been spoken
aloud.</p>

<p>It was expected that the final vote would be taken
without delay; but hour after hour wore on, and no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
report came from the mysterious hall where the fate
of a continent was in suspense. The multitude grew
impatient. The old man leaned over the railing,
straining his eyes downward, till his heart misgave
him, and hope yielded to fear. But at length, about
two o’clock the door of the hall opened, and a voice
exclaimed, “It has passed!”</p>

<p>The word leaped like lightning from lip to lip, followed
by huzzas that shook the building. The boy-sentinel
turned to the belfry, clapped his hands, and
shouted, “Ring! ring!” The desponding bell-man,
electrified into life by the joyful news, seized the iron
tongue and hurled it backward and forward with a
clang that startled every heart in Philadelphia like
a bugle blast.</p>

<p>“Clang! Clang!” the bell of Liberty resounded
on, higher and clearer and more joyous, blending in its
deep and thrilling vibration, and proclaiming in loud
and long accents over all the land the motto that encircled
it.</p>

<h3>THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">In Congress July 4, 1776</span></p>

<p class="center smaller">(The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United
States of America.)</p>

<p>When in the course of human events, it becomes
necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands
which have connected them with another, and to assume,
among the powers of the earth, the separate and
equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature’s
God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions
of mankind requires that they should declare the causes
which impel them to the separation.</p>

<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
are created equal, that they are endowed by their
Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among
these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
That to secure these rights, governments are instituted
among men, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed, that, whenever any form of
government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the
right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute
a new government, laying its foundation on
such principles and organizing its powers in such
form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate
that governments long established should not be
changed for light and transient causes; and, accordingly,
all experience hath shown, that mankind are
more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable,
than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to
which they are accustomed. But when a long train of
abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute
despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw
off such government, and to provide new guards for
their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance
of these colonies; and such is now the necessity
which constrains them to alter their former systems
of government. The history of the present King
of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and
usurpations, all having, in direct object, the establishment
of an absolute tyranny over these states. To
prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world:—</p>

<p>He has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome
and necessary for the public good.</p>

<p>He has forbidden his Governors to pass laws of
immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended
in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and
when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend
to them.</p>

<p>He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation
of large districts of people, unless those
people would relinquish the right of representation
in the legislature; a right inestimable to them, and
formidable to tyrants only.</p>

<p>He has called together legislative bodies at places
unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository
of their public records, for the sole purpose of
fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>

<p>He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly,
for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the
rights of the people.</p>

<p>He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions,
to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative
powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned
to the people at large for their exercise; the State<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers
of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</p>

<p>He has endeavored to prevent the population of
these States; for that purpose obstructing the laws for
naturalization of foreigners; refusing to pass others
to encourage their migration hither, and raising the
conditions of new appropriations of lands.</p>

<p>He has obstructed the administration of justice, by
refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary
powers.</p>

<p>He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for
the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment
of their salaries.</p>

<p>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent
hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat
out their substance.</p>

<p>He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing
armies without the consent of our legislature.</p>

<p>He has affected to render the military independent
of, and superior to, the civil power.</p>

<p>He has combined, with others, to subject us to a
jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged
by our laws; giving his assent to their acts
of pretended legislation:</p>

<p>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among
us:</p>

<p>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment
for any murders which they should commit on
the inhabitants of these States:</p>

<p>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</p>

<p>For imposing taxes on us without our consent:</p>

<p>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of
trial by jury:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended
offenses:</p>

<p>For abolishing the free system of English laws in
a neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary
government, and enlarging its boundaries so as
to render it at once an example and fit instrument for
introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies:</p>

<p>For taking away our charters, abolishing our most
valuable laws, and altering, fundamentally, the powers
of our governments:</p>

<p>For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring
themselves invested with power to legislate for us in
all cases whatsoever.</p>

<p>He has abdicated government here, by declaring us
out of his protection and waging war against us.</p>

<p>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts,
burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</p>

<p>He is, at this time, transporting large armies of
foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death,
desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances
of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the
most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head
of a civilized nation.</p>

<p>He has constrained our fellow citizens, taken captive
on the high seas, to bear arms against their country,
to become the executioners of their friends and
brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.</p>

<p>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us,
and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our
frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose known
rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of
all ages, sexes and conditions.</p>

<p>In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned
for redress in the most humble terms; our repeated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
petitions have been answered only by repeated
injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by
every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the
ruler of a free people.</p>

<p>Nor have we been wanting in attention to our
British brethren. We have warned them from time to
time of attempts made by their legislature to extend
an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded
them of the circumstances of our emigration
and settlement here. We have appealed to their native
justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured
them, by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow
these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt
our connections and correspondence. They, too, have
been deaf to the voice of justice and consanguinity.
We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which
denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold
the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace, friends.</p>

<p>We, therefore, the representatives of the United
States of America, in General Congress assembled, appealing
to the Supreme Judge of the World for the
rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the
authority of the good people of these colonies,
solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies
are, and of right ought to be, Free and Independent
States; that they are absolved from all allegiance
to the British crown, and that all political connection
between them and the state of Great Britain is, and
ought to be, totally dissolved; and that, as Free and
Independent States, they have full power to levy war,
conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce,
and to do all other acts and things which Independent
States may of right do. And, for the support of this
declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other,
our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.</p>

<h3>INDEPENDENCE EXPLAINED</h3>

<p class="author">BY SAMUEL ADAMS</p>

<p class="center smaller">(Delivered in Philadelphia, August 1, 1776, twenty-seven
days after the Declaration of Independence.)</p>

<p>My countrymen, from the day on which an accommodation
takes place between England and America
on any other terms than as independent States, I shall
date the ruin of this country. We are now, to the
astonishment of the world, three millions of souls
united in one common cause. This day we are called
on to give a glorious example of which the wisest and
best of men were rejoiced to view only in speculation.
This day presents the world with the most august
spectacle that its annals ever unfolded,—millions of
freemen voluntarily and deliberately forming themselves
into a society for their common defense and
common happiness. Immortal spirits of Hampden,
Locke, and Sidney! will it not add to your benevolent
joys to behold your posterity rising to the dignity of
<i>men</i>—evincing to the world the reality and expediency
of your systems, and in the actual enjoyment
of that equal liberty which you were happy when on
earth in delineating and recommending to mankind?</p>

<p>Other nations have received their laws from conquerors;
some are indebted for a constitution to the
sufferings of their ancestors through revolving centuries;
the people of this country alone have formally
and deliberately chosen a government for themselves,
and, with open, uninfluenced consent, bound themselves
into a social compact. And, fellow countrymen, if
ever it was granted to mortals to trace the designs of
Providence and interpret its manifestations in favor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
of their cause, we may, with humility of soul, cry out,
NOT UNTO US, NOT UNTO US, BUT TO THY
NAME BE THE PRAISE. The confusion of the
devices of our enemies, and the rage of the elements
against them, have done almost as much towards our
success as either our counsels or our arms.</p>

<p>The time at which this attempt in our liberties was
made,—when we were ripened into maturity, had acquired
a knowledge of war, and were free from the incursions
of intestine enemies,—the <i>gradual</i> advances
of our oppressors, enabling us to prepare for our defense,
the unusual fertility of our lands, the clemency
of the seasons, the success which at first attended our
feeble arms, producing unanimity among our friends
and compelling our internal foes to acquiescence,—these
are all strong and palpable marks and assurances
that Providence IS YET GRACIOUS UNTO ZION,
THAT IT WILL TURN AWAY THE CAPTIVITY
OF JACOB! Driven from every other corner
of the earth, freedom of thought and the right of private
judgment in matters of conscience direct their
course to this happy country as their last asylum. Let
us cherish the noble guests! Let us shelter them under
the wings of universal toleration! Be this the
seat of UNBOUNDED RELIGIOUS FREEDOM!
She will bring with her in her train, Industry, Wisdom,
and Commerce.</p>

<p>Our union is now complete. You have in the first
armies sufficient to repel the whole force of your enemies.
The hearts of your soldiers beat high with the
spirit of freedom. Go on, then, in your generous enterprise,
with gratitude to heaven for past success,
and confidence of it in the future! For my own part,
I ask no greater blessing than to share with you the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
common danger and the common glory. If I have a
wish dearer to my soul than that my ashes may be
mingled with those of a Warren and a Montgomery, it
is, THAT THESE AMERICAN STATES MAY
NEVER CEASE TO BE FREE AND INDEPENDENT!</p>

<h3>THE DIGNITY OF OUR NATION’S FOUNDERS</h3>

<p class="author">BY WILLIAM M. EVARTS</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence was, when it occurred,
a capital transaction in human affairs; as such
it has kept its place in history; as such it will maintain
itself while human interest in human institutions
shall endure. The scene and the actors, for their profound
impression on the world, at the time and ever
since, have owed nothing to dramatic effects, nothing
to epical exaggerations. To the eye there was nothing
wonderful or vast or splendid or pathetic in the
movement or the display. Imagination or art can
give no sensible grace or decoration to the persons,
the place, or the performance which made up the
business of that day. The worth and force that belong
to the agents and the action rest wholly on the
wisdom, the courage and the faith that formed and
executed the great design, and the potency and permanence
of its operation upon the affairs of the
world which followed as foreseen and legitimate consequences.</p>

<p>The dignity of the act is the deliberate, circumspect,
open and serene performance by these men, in the
clear light of day and by a concurrent purpose, of a
civic duty which embraced the greatest hazards to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
themselves and to all the people from whom they held
this disputed discretion but which to their sober
judgments promised benefits to that people and to
their posterity, exceeding these hazards and commensurate
with its own fitness. The question of their
conduct is to be measured by the actual weight and
pressure of the manifold considerations which surrounded
the subject before them and by the abundant
evidence that they comprehended their vastness and
variety. By a voluntary and responsible choice they
willed to do what was done and what without their
will would not have been done.</p>

<p>Thus estimated, the illustrious act covers all who
participated in it with its own renown and makes them
forever conspicuous among men, as it is forever famous
among events. And thus the signers of our
Declaration of Independence “wrote their names
where all nations should behold them and all time
should not efface them.” It was “in the course of
human events” intrusted to them to determine whether
the fullness of time had come when a nation should
be born in a day. They declared the independence of
a new nation in the sense in which men declare emancipation
or declare war,—the declaration created what
was declared.</p>

<p>Famous always among men are the founders of
states and fortunate above all others in such fame are
these, our fathers, whose combined wisdom and
courage began the great structure of our national existence
and laid sure the foundations of liberty and
justice on which it rests. Fortunate first in the clearness
of their title and in the world’s acceptance of their
rightful claim. Fortunate next in the enduring magnitude
of the State they founded and the beneficence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
its protection of the vast interests of human life and
happiness which have here had their home. Fortunate
again in the admiring imitations of their work
which the institutions of the most powerful and most
advanced nations more and more exhibit. Fortunate
last of all in the full demonstration of our later time
that their work is adequate to withstand the most
disastrous storms of human fortunes and survive unwrecked,
unshaken and unharmed.</p>

<h3>THE CHARACTER OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</h3>

<p class="author">BY GEORGE BANCROFT</p>

<p>This immortal State paper, which for its composer
was the aurora of enduring fame, was “the genuine
effusion of the soul of the country at that time,” the
revelation of its mind, when, in its youth, its enthusiasm,
its sublime confronting of danger, it rose to the
highest creative powers of which man is capable. The
bill of rights which it promulgates is of rights that
are older than human institutions, and spring from
the eternal justice that is anterior to the State.</p>

<p>Two political theories divided the world: one
founded the Commonwealth on the reason of State,
the policy of expediency; the other on the immutable
principles of morals. The new Republic, as it took its
place among the powers of the world, proclaimed its
faith in the truth and reality and unchangeableness of
freedom, virtue and right.</p>

<p>The heart of Jefferson, in writing the Declaration,
and of Congress in adopting it, beat for all humanity;
the assertion of right was made for the entire world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
of mankind, and all coming generations, without any
exception whatever; for the proposition which admits
of exceptions can never be self-evident. As it was put
forth in the name of the ascendant people of that time,
it was sure to make the circuit of the world, passing
everywhere through the despotic countries of Europe;
and the astonished nations, as they read that all men
are created equal, started out of their lethargy, like
those who have been exiles from childhood, when they
suddenly hear the dimly remembered accents of their
mother tongue.</p>

<h3>THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</h3>

<p class="author">BY HENRY T. RANDALL</p>

<p>To the Patriots, the Declaration gave strength and
courage. It gave them a definite purpose,—and a
name and object commensurate with the cost. When
it was formally read by the magistracy from the halls
of justice and in the public marts by the officers of the
army at the head of their divisions, by the clergy from
their pulpits, its grandeur impressed the popular imagination.
The American people pronounced it a fit
instrument, clothed in fitting words. The public enthusiasm
burst forth, sometimes in gay and festive,
and sometimes in solemn and religious, observances—as
the Cavalier or Puritan taste predominated.</p>

<p>In the Southern and Middle cities and villages, the
riotous populace tore down the images of monarchs
and Colonial governors and dragged them with ropes
round their necks through the streets—cannon thundered,
bonfires blazed—the opulent feasted, drank
toasts, and joined in hilarious celebrations. In New<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
England, the grimmer joy manifested itself in prayers
and sermons, and in religious rites.</p>

<h3>THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE</h3>

<p class="author">BY JOHN QUINCY ADAMS</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence! The interest
which in that paper has survived the occasion upon
which it was issued; the interest which is of every age
and every clime; the interest which quickens with the
lapse of years, spreads as it grows old, and brightens
as it recedes, is in the principles which it proclaims.
It was the first solemn declaration, by a nation, of the
only legitimate foundation of civil government. It
was the corner stone of a new fabric, destined to
cover the surface of the globe. It demolished at a
stroke the lawfulness of all governments founded
upon conquest. It swept away all the rubbish of accumulated
centuries of servitude. It announced in
practical form to the world the transcendent truth of
the inalienable sovereignty of the people. It proved
that the social compact was no figment of the imagination,
but a real, solid, and sacred bond of the
social union. From the day of this declaration
the people of North America were no longer
the fragment of a distant empire, imploring justice
and mercy from an inexorable master in another hemisphere.
They were no longer children, appealing in
vain to the sympathies of a heartless mother; no
longer subjects, leaning upon the shattered columns of
royal promises, and invoking the faith of parchment
to secure their rights. They were a nation, asserting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
as of right, and maintaining by war, its own existence.
A nation was born in a day.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will be acted o’er, but it never can be repeated.
It stands, and must forever stand, alone; a beacon
on the summit of the mountain, to which all the inhabitants
of the earth may turn their eyes for a genial
and saving light, till time shall be lost in eternity, and
this globe itself dissolves, nor leave a wreck behind.
It stands forever, a light of admonition to the rulers of
men, a light of salvation and redemption to the oppressed.
So long as this planet shall be inhabited by
human beings, so long as man shall be of social nature,
so long as government shall be necessary to the great
moral purposes of society, so long as it shall be abused
to the purposes of oppression—so long shall this
Declaration hold out to the sovereign and to the subject
the extent and boundaries of their respective
rights and duties, founded in the laws of nature and of

<h3>THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h3>

<p class="author">BY TUDOR JENKS</p>

<p>“What is the most dramatic incident in American
history and why?”</p>

<p>The emphatic and determining word in this question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
is the adverb “most.” To answer conclusively,
the method must be comparative; it is not enough to
stir the emotions of patriotism, to excite the imagination
of the poetic soul, to depict with skill bygone
scenes so that they live again. The intellectual faculties
must be satisfied that the chosen incident is truly
an incident, that it is dramatic, and that it is more
dramatic than all others in our history.</p>

<p>Definition seems but a poor prelude to the drama,
but as the defender of the Constitution began his reply
to Hayne by asking for the reading of the resolution
before the Senate, it may be permissible to refer to the
dictionary for guidance, as the storm-tossed mariner
of Webster’s metaphor glanced at the sun to rectify his
course.</p>

<p>“Incident,” as used in the given question, can mean
only “something which takes place in connection with
an event or series of events of greater importance”
(Century Dictionary), since any broader meaning of
the word would be too inclusive, and might permit
the naming of a whole epoch.</p>

<p>“Dramatic” (by the same author) is “characterized
by the force and animation in act or expression appropriate
to the drama.” Force and animation may
of course be psychical or physical; but if psychical
they must find expression in some form appreciable
by the senses, else they are not dramatic.</p>

<p>Bearing these guiding principles in mind, let us see
in what moment of American history we shall find
that incident so connected with greater events, and
so expressed as to be “The most dramatic”—that incident
toward which all preceding events led, and
from which subsequent events have sprung. Let us
then select as expressing that incident the most forceful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
and animated action that would be appropriate to
dramatic representation.</p>

<p>The periods of American history are the traditionary,
that of discovery and exploration, that of colonization.
These three are preparatory, and “American”
only in a geographical sense. Then come the
period of revolution, that of nationality and rebellion
and finally the present—which may be called the
period of expansion, since it marks for good or for evil
the birth of the nation as a world power.</p>

<p>These periods group naturally into two great classes:
I. America as an appanage of Europe. II. America
as independent. The transition from one existence
to the other took place in an instant of time. Before
the Declaration of Independence our nation did not
exist; once that document was ratified, the United
States was created a nation.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the dividing of the ways; here the
act of divine creation of which our forefathers were
but the human instruments. This is the one universally
celebrated and commemorated moment in our
history—the birth of “a new nation conceived in
liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men
are created equal.”</p>

<p>The great Civil war was but the test whether that
nation could endure; so said Lincoln, whom we are
learning to know as our greatest statesman. All our
subsequent history is but the voyage of the ship of
state by the chart then drafted.</p>

<p>Toward the Declaration converge all previous lines
of historical development; from the Declaration
diverge all the lines along which patriotic statesmanship
must hereafter guide the national future. Deviations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
from these converging and diverging paths have
been but blind trails to be painfully retraced.</p>

<p>Here, then, let us repeat, is the focus of our national
life.</p>

<p>In what act, in what incident shall we find this moment
of time expressed most dramatically?</p>

<p>The streets of Philadelphia were thronged with
citizens awaiting news of the action of Congress.
Within the old State House were the councilors of the
colonies—the group of contemporaries whom Gladstone
declared unequaled in the history of the world.
One by one the names of the representatives were
signed to that document which was to commit them to
death as rebels or to immortality as patriots.</p>

<p>As the last name was affixed, a little boy ran from
the doorway out into the street, and, tossing his arms
above his head, gave forth the tidings of a nation’s
birth in the words:</p>

<p class="center">“Ring! <i>Ring!</i> RING!”</p>

<p class="noindent">and then the Liberty Bell echoed the gospel, as foreordained
in its inscription: “Proclaim liberty to the
land: to all the inhabitants thereof.”</p>

<p>That is the most dramatic incident in American
history.</p>

<p>Whether we view its inception or its outcome, it
stands unrivaled. We shall forever “celebrate it
with thanksgiving” so long as the nation endures.</p>

<p>This incident responds to every test. It is the action
of a single person actuated by intense emotion;
he, a child, was a type of the fact he expressed;
through his puny action began the independent life of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
a nation to whose future none dares prescribe limits.</p>

<p>Discovery and colonization were inevitable, and are
common to all lands. Civil wars are expressions
rather than causes of great crises. Civil and commercial
progress are inevitable. But the Declaration
of Independence was an act of conscious choice.</p>

<p>No other incident in our history was so momentous,
none so dramatic and comprehensive of past and future.</p>

<p>Columbus was an unconscious instrument in opening
a new world; the Spanish, French, Dutch, and
English explorers were all working toward a consummation
none foresaw; the founders of colonies had
their ideals, but all have been swallowed up in our
national development. The Revolution alone looked
both backward and forward, and the fathers of the
republic gave us the law of our national being.</p>

<p>The birth-cry of the nation came from the lips of the
child who cried aloud in the streets:</p>

<p class="center">“Ring! <i>Ring!</i> RING!”</p>

<h3>THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IN THE LIGHT OF MODERN CRITICISM<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></h3>

<p class="author">BY MOSES COIT TYLER</p>

<p class="center smaller">(Professor of History in Cornell University.)</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>It can hardly be doubted that some hindrance to a
right estimate of the Declaration of Independence is
occasioned by either of two opposite conditions of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
mind, both of which are often to be met with among
us; on the one hand, a condition of hereditary, uncritical
awe and worship of the American Revolution, and
of that state paper as its absolutely perfect and glorious
expression; on the other hand, a later condition of
cultivated distrust of the Declaration, as a piece of
writing lifted up into inordinate renown by the passionate
and heroic circumstances of its origin, and
ever since then extolled beyond reason by the blind
energy of patriotic enthusiasm. Turning from the
former state of mind, which obviously calls for no further
comment, we may note, as a partial illustration of
the latter, that American confidence in the supreme intellectual
merit of this all-famous document received
a serious wound some forty years ago from the hand
of Rufus Choate, when, with a courage greater than
would now be required for such an act, he characterized
it as made up of “glittering and sounding generalities
of natural right.” What the great advocate
then so unhesitatingly suggested, many a thoughtful
American since then has at least suspected—that our
great proclamation, as a piece of political literature,
cannot stand the test of modern analysis; that it belongs
to the immense class of over-praised productions;
that it is, in fact, a stately patchwork of sweeping
propositions of somewhat doubtful validity; that it
has long imposed upon mankind by the well-known
effectiveness of verbal glitter and sound; that, at the
best, it is an example of florid political declamation belonging
to the sophomoric period of our national life,
a period which, as we flatter ourselves, we have now
outgrown.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is to be noted that whatever authority
the Declaration of Independence has acquired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
in the world, has been due to no lack of criticism, either
at the time of its first appearance, or since then; a
fact which seems to tell in favor of its essential worth
and strength. From the date of its original publication
down to the present moment, it has been attacked
again and again, either in anger, or in contempt, by
friends as well as by enemies of the American Revolution,
by liberals in politics as well as by conservatives.
It has been censured for its substance, it has been
censured for its form, for its misstatements of fact,
for its fallacies in reasoning, for its audacious novelties
and paradoxes, for its total lack of all novelty, for its
repetition of old and threadbare statements, even for
its downright plagiarisms; finally, for its grandiose
and vaporing style.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>One of the earliest and ablest of its assailants was
Thomas Hutchinson, the last civil governor of the
colony of Massachusetts, who, being stranded in London
by the political storm which had blown him
thither, published there, in the autumn of 1776, his
“Strictures upon the Declaration of the Congress at
Philadelphia,” wherein, with an unsurpassed knowledge
of the origin of the controversy, and with an unsurpassed
acumen in the discussion of it, he traverses
the entire document, paragraph by paragraph, for the
purpose of showing that its allegations in support of
American Independence are “false and frivolous.”</p>

<p>A better written, and, upon the whole, a more plausible
and a more powerful arraignment of the great
Declaration was the celebrated pamphlet by Sir John
Dalrymple, “The Rights of Great Britain Asserted
against the Claims of America: Being an Answer to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
the Declaration of the General Congress,”—a pamphlet
scattered broadcast over the world at such a rate
that at least eight editions of it were published during
the last three or four months of the year, 1776. Here,
again, the manifesto of Congress is subjected to a
searching examination, in order to prove that “the
facts are either willfully or ignorantly misrepresented,
and the arguments deduced from premises that have
no foundation in truth.” It is doubtful if any disinterested
student of history, any competent judge of
reasoning, will now deny to this pamphlet the praise
of making out a very strong case against the historical
accuracy and the logical soundness of many parts of
the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the force of such censures is for us
much broken by the fact that they proceeded from
men who were themselves partisans in the Revolutionary
controversy, and bitterly hostile to the whole
movement which the Declaration was intended to
justify. Such is not the case, however, with the leading
modern English critics of the same document,
who while blaming in severe terms the policy of the
British Government toward the Thirteen Colonies, have
also found much to abate from the confidence due to
this official announcement of the reasons for our
secession from the empire. For example, Earl Russell,
after frankly saying that the great disruption
proclaimed by the Declaration of Independence was a
result which Great Britain had “used every means
most fitted to bring about,” such as “vacillation in
council, harshness in language, feebleness in execution,
disregard of American sympathies and affections,”
also pointed out that “the truth of this memorable
Declaration” was “warped” by “one singular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
defect,” namely, its exclusive and excessive arraignment
of George the Third, “as a single and despotic
tyrant,” much like Philip the Second to the people of
the Netherlands.</p>

<p>This temperate criticism from an able and a liberal
English statesman of the present century may be said
to touch the very core of the problem as to the historic
justice of our great indictment of the last King of
America; and there is deep significance in the fact
that this is the very criticism upon the document,
which, as John Adams tells us, he himself had in mind
when it was first submitted to him in committee, and
even, when, shortly afterward, he advocated its
adoption by Congress. After mentioning certain
things in it with which he was delighted, he adds:</p>

<p>“There were other expressions which I would not
have inserted if I had drawn it up—particularly that
which called the king tyrant. I thought this too personal;
for I never believed George to be a tyrant in
disposition and in nature. I always believed him to
be deceived by his courtiers on both sides of the Atlantic,
and in his official capacity only cruel. I thought
the expression too passionate, and too much like
scolding, for so grave and solemn a document; but, as
Franklin and Sherman were to inspect it afterwards
I thought it would not become me to strike it out. I
consented to report it.”</p>

<p>A more minute and a more poignant criticism of
the Declaration of Independence has been made in
recent years by still another English writer of liberal
tendencies, who, however, in his capacity as critic,
seems here to labor under the disadvantage of having
transferred to the document which he undertakes to
judge much of the extreme dislike which he has for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
the man who wrote it, whom, indeed, he regards as a
sophist, as a demagogue, as quite capable of inveracity
in speech, and as bearing some resemblance to Robespierre
“in his feline nature, his malignant egotism,
and his intense suspiciousness, as well as in his bloody-minded,
yet possibly sincere, philanthropy.” In the
opinion of Prof. Goldwin Smith, our great national
manifesto is written “in a highly rhetorical strain;
it opens with sweeping aphorisms about the natural
rights of man, at which political science now smiles,
and which ... might seem strange when framed
for slave-holding communities by a publicist who himself
held slaves”; while, in his specifications of fact,
it “is not more scrupulously truthful than are the
general utterances” of the statesman who was its
scribe. Its charges that the several offensive acts
of the king, besides “evincing a design to reduce
the colonists under absolute despotism,” “all had as
their direct object the establishment of an absolute
tyranny,” are simply “propositions which history cannot
accept.” Moreover, the Declaration “blinks the
fact that many of the acts, styled steps of usurpation,
were measures of repression, which, however
unwise or excessive, had been provoked by popular
outrage. No government could allow its officers to
be assaulted and their houses sacked, its loyal lieges
to be tarred and feathered, or the property of merchants
sailing under its flag to be thrown by lawless
hands into the sea.” Even “the preposterous violence
and the manifest insincerity of the suppressed
clause” against slavery and the slave-trade “are
enough to create suspicion as to the spirit in which
the whole document was framed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Finally, as has been already intimated, not even
among Americans themselves has the Declaration of
Independence been permitted to pass on into the enjoyment
of its superb renown, without much critical
disparagement at the hands of statesmen and historians.
No doubt Calhoun had its preamble in mind
when he declared that “nothing can be more unfounded
and false” than “the prevalent opinion that
all men are born free and equal”; for “it rests upon
the assumption of a fact which is contrary to universal
observation.” Of course, all Americans who
have shared to any extent in Calhoun’s doctrines respecting
human society could hardly fail to agree with
him in regarding as fallacious and worthless those
general propositions in the Declaration which seem to
constitute its logical starting point, as well as its ultimate
defense.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the most frequent form of disparagement
to which Jefferson’s great state paper has
been subjected among us is that which would minimize
his merit in composing it, by denying to it the merit
of originality. For example, Richard Henry Lee
sneered at it as a thing “copied from Locke’s
<i>Treatise on Government</i>.” The author of a life of
Jefferson, published in the year of Jefferson’s retirement
from the presidency, suggests that the credit of
having composed the Declaration of Independence
“has been perhaps more generally, than truly, given
by the public” to that great man. Charles Campbell,
the historian of Virginia, intimates that some expressions
in the document were taken without acknowledgment
from Aphra Behn’s tragi-comedy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
“The Widow-Ranter, or the History of Bacon in Virginia.”
John Stockton Littell describes the Declaration
of Independence as “that enduring monument
at once of patriotism, and of genius and skill in the
art of appropriation”—asserting that “for the sentiments
and much of the language” of it, Jefferson
was indebted to Chief Justice Brayton’s charge to the
grand jury of Charleston, delivered in April, 1776, as
well as to the Declaration of Independence said to
have been adopted by some citizens of Mecklenburg
County, North Carolina, in May, 1775. Even the
latest and most critical editor of the writings of Jefferson
calls attention to the fact that a glance at the
Declaration of Rights, as adopted by Virginia on the
12th of June, 1776, “would seem to indicate the
source from which Jefferson derived a most important
and popular part” of his famous production.
By no one, however, has the charge of a lack of
originality been pressed with so much decisiveness
as by John Adams, who took evident pleasure in
speaking of it as a document in which were merely
“recapitulated” previous and well-known statements
of American rights and wrongs, and who, as late as
in the year 1822, deliberately wrote:</p>

<p>“There is not an idea in it but what had been
hackneyed in Congress for two years before. The
substance of it is contained in the declaration of
rights and the violation of those rights, in the Journals
of Congress, in 1774. Indeed, the essence of it
is contained in a pamphlet, voted and printed by the
town of Boston, before the first Congress met, composed
by James Otis, as I suppose, in one of his lucid
intervals, and pruned and polished by Samuel Adams.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Perhaps nowhere in our literature would it be possible
to find a criticism brought forward by a really
able man against any piece of writing less applicable
to the case, and of less force and value, than is this
particular criticism by John Adams and others, as to
the lack of originality in the Declaration of Independence.
Indeed, for such a paper as Jefferson was commissioned
to write, the one quality which it could not
properly have had, the one quality which would have
been fatal to its acceptance either by the American
Congress or by the American people—is originality.
They were then at the culmination of a tremendous
controversy over alleged grievances of the most
serious kind—a controversy that had been steadily
raging for at least twelve years. In the course of
that long dispute, every phase of it, whether as to
abstract right or constitutional privilege or personal
procedure, had been presented in almost every conceivable
form of speech. At last, they had resolved,
in view of all this experience, no longer to prosecute
the controversy as members of the empire; they had
resolved to revolt, and, casting off forever their ancient
fealty to the British crown, to separate from
the empire, and to establish themselves as a new
nation among the nations of the earth. In this
emergency as it happened, Jefferson was called upon
to put into form a suitable statement of the chief
considerations which prompted them to this great act
of revolution, and which, as they believed, justified
it. What, then, was Jefferson to do? Was he to
regard himself as a mere literary essayist, set to
produce before the world a sort of prize-dissertation—a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
calm, analytic, judicial treatise on history and
politics with a particular application to Anglo-American
affairs—one essential merit of which
would be its originality as a contribution to historical
and political literature? Was he not, rather, to regard
himself, as, for the time being, the very mouthpiece
and prophet of the people whom he represented,
and as such required to bring together and to set in
order, in their name, not what was new, but what
was old; to gather up into his own soul, as much as
possible, whatever was then also in their souls, their
very thoughts and passions, their ideas of constitutional
law, their interpretations of fact, their opinions
as to men and as to events in all that ugly quarrel,
their notions of justice, of civic dignity, of human
rights; finally, their memories of wrongs which
seemed to them intolerable, especially of wrongs inflicted
upon them during those twelve years by the
hands of insolent and brutal men, in the name of the
king, and by his apparent command?</p>

<p>Moreover, as the nature of the task laid upon him
made it necessary that he should thus state, as the
reasons for their intended act, those very considerations
both as to fact and as to opinion which had
actually operated upon their minds, so did it require
him to do so, to some extent, in the very language
which the people themselves, in their more formal and
deliberate utterances, had all along been using. In
the development of political life in England and
America, there had already been created a vast literature
of constitutional progress—a literature common
to both portions of the English race, pervaded by its
own stately traditions, and reverberating certain great
phrases which formed, as one may say, almost the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
vernacular of English justice, and of English aspiration
for a free, manly and orderly political life. In
this vernacular the Declaration of Independence was
written. The phraseology thus characteristic of it is
the very phraseology of the champions of constitutional
expansion, of civic dignity and progress, within
the English race ever since Magna Charta; of the
great state papers of English freedom in the seventeenth
century, particularly the Petition of Right in
1629, and the Bill of Rights in 1789; of the great
English Charters for colonization in America; of the
great English exponents of legal and political progress—Sir
Edward Coke, John Milton, Sir Philip Sidney,
John Locke; finally, of the great American exponents
of political liberty, and of the chief representative
bodies, whether local or general, which had convened
in America from the time of Stamp Act Congress
until that of the Congress which resolved upon our
independence. To say, therefore, that the official
declaration of that resolve is a paper made up of the
very opinions, beliefs, unbeliefs, the very sentiments,
prejudices, passions, even the errors in judgment and
the personal misconstructions—if they were such—which
then actually impelled the American people
to that mighty act, and that all these are expressed
in the very phrases which they had been accustomed
to use, is to pay to that state-paper the highest tribute
as to its fitness for the purpose for which it was
framed.</p>

<p>Of much of this, also, Jefferson himself seems to
have been conscious; and perhaps never does he rise
before us with more dignity, with more truth, than
when, late in his lifetime, hurt by the captious and
jangling words of disparagement then recently put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
into writing by his old comrade, to the effect that the
Declaration of Independence “contained no new
ideas, that it is a commonplace compilation, its sentences
hackneyed in Congress for two years before,
and its essence contained in Otis’s pamphlet,” Jefferson
quietly remarked that perhaps these statements
might “all be true: of that I am not to be the judge....
Whether I had gathered my ideas from reading
or reflection, I do not know. I know only that
I turned to neither book nor pamphlet while writing
it. I did not consider it as any part of my charge
to invent new ideas altogether and to offer no sentiment
which had ever been expressed before.”</p>

<p>Before passing from this phase of the subject, however,
it should be added that, while the Declaration
of Independence lacks originality in the sense just
indicated, in another and perhaps in a higher sense,
it possesses originality—it is individualized by the
character and by the genius of its author. Jefferson
gathered up the thoughts and emotions and even
the characteristic phrases of the people for whom
he wrote, and these he perfectly incorporated with
what was already in his mind, and then to the music
of his own keen, rich, passionate, and enkindling
style, he mustered them into that stately and triumphant
procession wherein, as some of us still think,
they will go marching on to the world’s end.</p>

<p>There were then in Congress several other men
who could have written the Declaration of Independence,
and written it well—notably Franklin, either
of the two Adamses, Richard Henry Lee, William
Livingston, and, best of all, but for his own opposition
to the measure, John Dickinson; but had any
one of these other men written the Declaration of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
Independence, while it would have contained, doubtless,
nearly the same topics and nearly the same great
formulas of political statement, it would yet have been
a wholly different composition from this of Jefferson’s.
No one at all familiar with his other writings,
as well as with the writings of his chief contemporaries,
could ever have a moment’s doubt, even
if the fact were not already notorious, that this document
was by Jefferson. He put into it something
that was his own, and that no one else could have
put there. He put himself into it—his own genius,
his own moral force, his faith in God, his faith in
ideas, his love of innovation, his passion for progress,
his invincible enthusiasm, his intolerance of prescription,
of injustice, of cruelty; his sympathy, his
clarity of vision, his affluence of diction, his power
to fling out great phrases which will long fire and
cheer the souls of men struggling against political
unrighteousness.</p>

<p>And herein lies its essential originality, perhaps the
most precious, and, indeed, almost the only originality
ever attaching to any great literary product that is
representative of its time. He made for himself no
improper claim, therefore, when he directed that upon
the granite obelisk at his grave should be carved the
words: “Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, author
of the Declaration of Independence.”</p>

<h4>V</h4>

<p>If the Declaration of Independence is now to be
fairly judged by us, it must be judged with reference
to what it was intended to be, namely, an impassioned
manifesto of one party, and that the
weaker party, in a violent race-quarrel; of a party<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
resolved, at last, upon the extremity of revolution,
and already menaced by the inconceivable disaster of
being defeated in the very act of armed rebellion
against the mightiest military power on earth. This
manifesto, then, is not to be censured because, being
avowedly a statement of his own side of the quarrel,
it does not also contain a moderate and judicial statement
of the opposite side; or because, being necessarily
partisan in method, it is likewise both partisan
and vehement in tone; or because it bristles with accusations
against the enemy so fierce and so unqualified
as now to seem in some respects overdrawn;
or because it resounds with certain great aphorisms
about the natural rights of man, at which, indeed,
political science cannot now smile, except to its own
discomfiture and shame—aphorisms which are likely
to abide in this world as the chief source and inspiration
of heroic enterprises among men for self-deliverance
from oppression.</p>

<p>Taking into account, therefore, as we are bound to
do, the circumstances of its origin, and especially its
purpose as a solemn and piercing appeal to mankind
on behalf of a small and weak nation against the
alleged injustice and cruelty of a great and powerful
one, it still remains our duty to inquire whether, as
has been asserted in our time, history must set aside
either of the two central charges embodied in the
Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>The first of these charges affirms that the several
acts complained of by the colonists evinced “a design
to reduce them under absolute despotism,” and
had as their “direct object the establishment of an
absolute tyranny” over the American people. Was
this, indeed, a groundless charge, in the sense intended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
by the words “despotism” and “tyranny”—that
is, in the sense commonly given to those words
in the usage of the English-speaking race? According
to that usage, it was not an Oriental despotism
that was meant, nor a Greek tyranny, nor a Roman,
nor a Spanish. The sort of despot, the sort of tyrant,
whom the English people, ever since the time of King
John and especially during the period of the Stuarts,
had been accustomed to look for and to guard against,
was the sort of tyrant or despot that could be evolved
out of the conditions of English political life. Furthermore,
he was not by them expected to appear
among them at the outset in the fully developed shape
of a Philip or an Alva in the Netherlands. They
were able to recognize him, they were prepared to
resist him, in the earliest and most incipient stage
of his being—at the moment, in fact, when he should
make his first attempt to gain all power over his
people, by assuming the single power to take their
property without their consent. Hence it was, as
Edmund Burke pointed out in the House of Commons
only a few weeks before the American Revolution
entered upon its military phase, that:</p>

<p>“The great contests for freedom ... were
from the earliest times chiefly upon the question of
taxing. Most of the contests in the ancient commonwealths
turned primarily on the right of election
of magistrates, or on the balance among the several
orders of the state. The question of money was not
with them so immediate. But in England it was
otherwise. On this point of taxes the ablest pens
and most eloquent tongues have been exercised, the
greatest spirits have acted and suffered....
They took infinite pains to inculcate, as a fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
principle, that in all monarchies the people
must in effect, themselves, mediately or immediately,
possess the power of granting their own money, or
no shadow of liberty could subsist. The colonies
draw from you, as with their life-blood, these ideas
and principles. Their love of liberty, as with you,
fixed and attached on this specific point of taxing.
Liberty might be safe or might be endangered in
twenty other particulars without their being much
pleased or alarmed. Here they felt its pulse, and as
they found that beat, they thought themselves sick
or sound.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, the meaning which the English race
on both sides of the Atlantic were accustomed to attach
to the words “tyranny” and “despotism,” was
a meaning to some degree ideal; it was a meaning
drawn from the extraordinary political sagacity with
which the race is endowed, from their extraordinary
sensitiveness as to the use of the taxing-power in
government, from their instinctive perception of the
commanding place of the taxing-power among all the
other forms of power in the state, from their perfect
assurance that he who holds the purse with the power
to fill it and to empty it, holds the key of the situation—can
maintain an army of his own, can rule
without consulting Parliament, can silence criticism,
can crush opposition, can strip his subjects of every
vestige of political life; in other words, he can make
slaves of them, he can make a despot and a tyrant
of himself. Therefore, the system which in the end
might develop into results so palpably tyrannic and
despotic, they bluntly called a tyranny and a despotism
in the beginning. To say, therefore, that the
Declaration of Independence did the same, is to say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
that it spoke good English. Of course, history will
be ready to set aside the charge thus made in language
not all liable to be misunderstood, just so soon as
history is ready to set aside the common opinion that
the several acts of the British government, from 1764
to 1776, for laying and enforcing taxation in America,
did evince a somewhat particular and systematic
design to take away some portion of the
property of the American people without their consent.</p>

<p>The second of the two great charges contained in
the Declaration of Independence, while intimating
that some share in the blame is due to the British
Parliament and to the British people, yet fastens upon
the king himself as the one person chiefly responsible
for the scheme of American tyranny therein set
forth, and culminates in the frank description of him
as “a prince whose character is thus marked by every
act which may define a tyrant.” Is this accusation
of George the Third now to be set aside as unhistoric?
Was that king, or was he not, chiefly responsible
for the American policy of the British government
between the years 1764 and 1776? If he was
so, then the historic soundness of the most important
portion of the Declaration of Independence is
vindicated.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this question can be answered without
hesitation, and in a few words; and for these few
words, an American writer of to-day, conscious of
his own bias of nationality, will rightly prefer to cite
such words as have been uttered upon the subject
by the ablest English historians of our time. Upon
their statements alone it must be concluded that
George the Third ascended his throne with the fixed
purpose of resuming to the crown many of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
powers which, by the constitution of England, did not
then belong to it, and that in this purpose, at least
during the first twenty-five years of his reign, he
substantially succeeded—himself determining what
should be the policy of each administration, what
opinions his ministers should advocate in Parliament,
and what measures Parliament itself should adopt.
Says Sir Erskine May:</p>

<p>“The king desired to undertake personally the chief
administration of public affairs, to direct the policy
of his ministers, and himself to distribute the patronage
of the crown. He was ambitious not only to
reign, but to govern. Strong as were the ministers,
the king was resolved to wrest all power from
their hands, and to exercise it himself. But what
was this in effect but to assert that the king should
be his own minister?... The king’s tactics were
fraught with danger, as well to the crown itself as to
the constitutional liberties of the people.”</p>

<p>Already prior to the year 1778, according to
Lecky, the king had “laboriously built up” in England
a “system of personal government”; and it was
because he was unwilling to have this system disturbed
that he then refused, “in defiance of the most
earnest representations of his own minister and of
the most eminent politicians of every party ...
to send for the greatest of living statesmen at the
moment when the empire appeared to be in the very
agonies of dissolution.... Either Chatham or
Rockingham should have insisted that the policy of
the country should be directed by its responsible ministers
and not dictated by an irresponsible sovereign.”</p>

<p>This refusal of the king to pursue the course which
was called for by the constitution, and which would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
have taken the control of the policy of the government
out of his hands, was, according to the same
great historian, an act “the most criminal in the whole
reign of George the Third; ... as criminal as
any of those acts which led Charles the First to the
scaffold.”</p>

<p>Even so early as the year 1768, according to John
Richard Green,</p>

<p>“George the Third had at last reached his aim....
In the early days of the ministry” (which
began in that year) “his influence was felt to be
predominant. In its later and more disastrous days
it was supreme; for Lord North, who became the
head of the ministry on Grafton’s retirement in 1770,
was the mere mouthpiece of the king. ‘Not only
did he direct the minister,’ a careful observer tells
us, ‘in all important matters of foreign and domestic
policy, but he instructed him as to the management
of debates in Parliament, suggested what motions
should be made or opposed, and how measures should
be carried. He reserved for himself all the patronage,
he arranged the whole cast of the administration,
settled the relative place and pretentions of
ministers of state, law officers, and members of the
household, nominated and promoted the English and
Scotch judges, appointed and translated bishops and
deans, and dispensed other preferments in the church.
He disposed of military governments, regiments, and
commissions, and himself ordered the marching of
troops. He gave and refused titles, honors, and pensions.’
All this immense patronage was steadily used
for the creation of a party in both houses of Parliament
attached to the king himself.... George,
was, in fact, sole minister during the fifteen years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
which followed; and the shame of the darkest hour
of English history lies wholly at his door.”</p>

<p>Surely, until these tremendous verdicts of English
history shall be set aside, there need be no anxiety
in any quarter as to the historic soundness of the
two great accusations which together make up the
principal portion of the Declaration of Independence.
In the presence of these verdicts also, even the passion,
the intensity of language, in which those accusations
are uttered, seem to find a perfect justification.
Indeed, in the light of the most recent and
most unprejudiced expert testimony, the whole document,
both in its substance and in its form, seems to
have been the logical response of a nation of brave
men to the great words of the greatest of English
statesmen, as spoken in the House of Commons precisely
ten years before:</p>

<p>“This kingdom has no right to lay a tax on the
colonies. Sir, I rejoice that America has resisted.
Three millions of people, so dead to all the feelings
of liberty as voluntarily to submit to be slaves, would
have been fit instruments to make slaves of the rest.”</p>

<h4>VI</h4>

<p>Thus, ever since its first announcement to the
world, and down almost to the present moment, has
the Declaration of Independence been tested by criticism
of every possible kind—by criticism intended
and expected to be destructive. Apparently, however,
all this criticism has failed to accomplish its
object.</p>

<p>It is proper for us to remember, also, that what
we call criticism is not the only valid test of the
genuineness and worth of any piece of writing of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
great practical interest to mankind; there is, in addition,
the test of actual use and service, in direct contact
with the common sense and the moral sense of
large masses of men, under various conditions, and
for a long period. Probably no writing which is not
essentially sound and true has ever survived this
test.</p>

<p>Neither from this test has the great Declaration
any need to shrink. As to the immediate use for
which it was sent forth—that of rallying and uniting
the friends of the Revolution, and bracing them for
their great task—its effectiveness was so great and
so obvious that it has never been denied. During the
century and a quarter since the Revolution, its influence
on the political character and the political conduct
of the American people has been great beyond
calculation. For example, after we had achieved our
own national deliverance, and had advanced into that
enormous and somewhat corrupting material prosperity
which followed the adoption of the constitution and
the development of the cotton-interest and the expansion
of the Republic into a transcontinental power,
we fell under an appalling temptation—the temptation
to forget, or to repudiate, or to refuse to apply
to the case of our human brethren in bondage, the
principles which we had once proclaimed as the basis
of every rightful government. The prodigious service
rendered to us in this awful moral emergency by the
Declaration of Independence, was, that its public
repetition, at least once every year, in the hearing
of vast throngs of the American people in every
portion of the Republic, kept constantly before our
minds, in a form of almost religious sanctity, those
few great ideas as to the dignity of human nature,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
and the sacredness of personality, and the indestructible
rights of man as mere man, with which it had
so gloriously identified the beginnings of our national
existence. It did at last become very hard for us
to listen each year to the preamble of the Declaration
and still remain the owners and users and
catchers of slaves; still harder, to accept the doctrine
that the righteousness and prosperity of slavery was
to be accepted as the dominant policy of the nation.
The logic of Calhoun was as flawless as usual, when
he concluded that the chief obstruction in the way
of his system was the preamble of the Declaration
of Independence. Had it not been for the inviolable
sacredness given by it to those sweeping aphorisms
about the natural rights of man, it may be doubted
whether Calhoun might not have won over an immense
majority of the American people to the support
of his compact and plausible scheme for making
slavery the basis of the Republic. It was the
preamble of the Declaration of Independence which
elected Lincoln, which sent forth the Emancipation
Proclamation, which gave victory to Grant, which ratified
the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>

<p>We shall not here attempt to delineate the influence
of this state paper upon mankind in general.
Of course, the emergence of the American Republic
as an imposing world-power is a phenomenon which
has now for many years attracted the attention of
the human race. Surely, no slight effect must have
resulted from the fact that, among all civilized peoples,
the one American document best known is the
Declaration of Independence, and that thus the
spectacle of so vast and beneficent a political success
has been everywhere associated with the assertion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
of the natural rights of man. “The doctrines it contained,”
says Buckle, “were not merely welcomed by
a majority of the French nation, but even the government
itself was unable to withstand the general
feeling. Its effect in hastening the approach of
the French Revolution ... was indeed most remarkable.”
Elsewhere, also, in many lands, among
many peoples, it has been cited again and again as
an inspiration to political courage, as a model for
political conduct; and if, as the brilliant historian
just alluded to has affirmed, “that noble Declaration
... ought to be hung up in the nursery of every
king, and blazoned on the porch of every royal
palace,” it is because it has become the classic statement
of political truths which must at last abolish
kings altogether, or else teach them to identify their
existence with the dignity and happiness of human
nature.</p>

<h3>THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REVOLUTION</h3>

<p class="author">BY JOSIAH QUINCY</p>

<p>When we speak of the glory of our fathers, we
mean not that vulgar renown to be attained by
physical strength; nor yet that higher fame, to be acquired
by intellectual power. Both often exist without
lofty thought, pure intent, or generous purpose.
The glory which we celebrate was strictly of a moral
and religious character: righteous as to its ends; just
as to its means.</p>

<p>The American Revolution had its origin neither in
ambition, nor avarice, nor envy, nor in any gross
passion; but in the nature and relation of things, and
in the thence-resulting necessity of separation from
the parent state. Its progress was limited by that
necessity. Our fathers displayed great strength and
great moderation of purpose. In difficult times they
conducted it with wisdom; in doubtful times, with
firmness; in perilous times, with courage; under oppressive
trials, erect; amidst temptations, unseduced;
in the dark hour of danger, fearless; in the bright
hour of prosperity, faithful.</p>

<p>It was not the instant feeling and pressure of
despotism that roused them to resist, but the principle
on which that arm was extended. They could
have paid the impositions of the British government,
had they been increased a thousandfold; but payment
acknowledged right, and they spurned the consequences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
of that acknowledgment. But, above all,
they realized that those burdens, though light in themselves,
would to coming ages—to us, their posterity—be
heavy, and probably insupportable. They preferred
to meet the trial in their own times, and to
make the sacrifices in their own persons, that we and
our descendants, their posterity, might reap the harvest
and enjoy the increase.</p>

<p>Generous men, exalted patriots, immortal statesmen!
For this deep moral and social affection, for
this elevated self-devotion, this bold daring, the multiplying
millions of your posterity, as they spread backward
to the lakes, and from the lakes to the mountains,
and from the mountains to the western waters,
shall annually, in all future time, come up to the
temples of the Most High, with song and anthem,
and thanksgiving; with cheerful symphonies and hallelujahs,
to repeat your names; to look steadfastly on
the brightness of your glory; to trace its spreading
rays to the points from which they emanate; and to
seek in your character and conduct a practical illustration
of public duty in every occurring social exigency.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">The muster of men at the barrack door,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the measured tread of the grenadiers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Marching down to their boats on the shore.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">On a shadowy something far away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the river widens to meet the bay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A line of black that bends and floats</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Now he patted his horse’s side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now gazed at the landscape far and near,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, impetuous, stamped the earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But mostly he watched with eager search</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The belfry-tower of the Old North Church,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Lonely, and spectral, and somber and still.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A second lamp in the belfry burns!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A hurry of hoofs in a village street,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fate of a nation was riding that night;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">He has left the village and mounted the steep,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And under the alders, that skirt its edge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">It was twelve by the village clock</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He heard the crowing of the cock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the barking of the farmer’s dog,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Then crossing the fields to emerge again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Under the trees at the turn of the road,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And only pausing to fire and load.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So through the night rode Paul Revere;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And so through the night went his cry of alarm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To every Middlesex village and farm,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A cry of defiance and not of fear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a word that shall echo forevermore!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through all our history, to the last,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the hour of darkness and peril and need,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The people will waken and listen to hear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the midnight message of Paul Revere.</div>

<h3>THE REVOLUTIONARY ALARM</h3>

<p class="author">BY GEORGE BANCROFT</p>

<p>Darkness closed upon the country and upon the
town, but it was no night for sleep. Heralds on swift
relays of horses transmitted the war-message from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
hand to hand, till village repeated it to village; the
sea to the backwoods; the plains to the highlands;
and it was never suffered to droop till it had been
borne North and South, and East and West, throughout
the land.</p>

<p>It spread over the bays that receive the Saco and
the Penobscot. Its loud reveille broke the rest of the
trappers of New Hampshire, and, ringing like bugle-notes
from peak to peak, overleapt the Green Mountains,
swept onward to Montreal, and descended the
ocean river, till the responses were echoed from
the cliffs of Quebec. The hills along the Hudson told to
one another the tale.</p>

<p>As the summons hurried to the south, it was one day
at New York; in one more at Philadelphia; the next
it lighted a watchfire at Baltimore; thence it waked
an answer at Annapolis. Crossing the Potomac near
Mount Vernon, it was sent forward without a halt to
Williamsburg. It traversed the Dismal Swamp to
Nansemond, along the route of the first emigrants to
North Carolina. It moved onwards and still onwards,
through boundless groves of evergreen, to New-Berne
and to Wilmington.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, forward it by night and by day,”
wrote Cornelius Harnett, by the express which sped
for Brunswick. Patriots of South Carolina caught up
its tones at the border and despatched it to Charleston,
and through pines and palmettos and moss-clad live-oaks,
farther to the south, till it resounded among the
New England settlements beyond Savannah.</p>

<p>The Blue Ridge took up the voice, and made it
heard from one end to the other of the valley of
Virginia. The Alleghanies, as they listened, opened
their barriers, that the “loud call” might pass through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
to the hardy riflemen on the Holston, the Watauga,
and the French Broad. Ever renewing its strength,
powerful enough even to create a commonwealth, it
breathed its inspiring word to the first settlers of Kentucky;
so that hunters who made their halt in the
matchless valley of the Elkhorn commemorated the
19th day of April, 1775, by naming their encampment
<i>Lexington</i>.</p>

<p>With one impulse the colonies sprung to arms; with
one spirit they pledged themselves to each other “to
be ready for the extreme event.” With one heart the
continent cried, “Liberty or Death!”</p>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL</h3>

<p class="center smaller">(From “Battles of the American Revolution.”)</p>

<p>The advance of the British army was like a solemn
pageant in its steady headway, and like a parade for
inspection in the completeness of its outfit. It moved
forward as if by the very force of its closely-knit
columns it must sweep away every barrier in its path.
Elated, sure of victory, with firm step, already quickened
as the space of separation lessens, there is left
but a few rods of interval, a few steps only, and the
work is done! But right in their way was a calm,
intense, and energizing love of liberty, represented
by men of the same blood and of equal daring.</p>

<p>A few shots impulsively fired, but quickly restrained,
drew an innocent fire from the advancing column.
But the pale men behind the scant defense, obedient to
one will, answered not.... The left wing is
near the redoubt. It surely is nothing to surmount
a bank of fresh earth but six feet high; and its
sands and clods can almost be counted, it is so near,
so easy, <i>sure</i>! Short, crisp, and earnest, low-toned,
but felt as an electric pulse from redoubt to river, are
the words of a single man, Prescott. Warren, by his
side, repeats them. The word runs quickly along the
impatient line. The eager fingers give back from the
waiting trigger. “Steady, men! Wait until you see
the white of the eye! Not a shot sooner! Aim at
the handsome coats! Aim at the waistbands! Pick
off the officers! Wait for the word, every man!
Steady!”</p>

<p>Already those plain men, so patient, can count the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
buttons, can read the emblems on the belt-plate, can
recognize the officers and men whom they have seen at
parade on Boston Common. Features grow more and
more distinct. The silence is awful! These men seem
breathless,—dead! It comes, that word, the word
waited for,—“Fire!” That word had waited behind
the center and the left wing, where Putnam watched,
as it lingered behind breastwork and redoubt. Sharp,
clear, and deadly, in tone and essence, it rings forth,—“Fire!”</p>

<p>From redoubt to river, along the whole sweep of
devouring flame, the forms of men wither as in a furnace
heat. The whole front goes down. For an instant
the chirp of the grasshopper and the cricket in
the freshly-cut grass might almost be heard; then the
groans of the suffering; then the shouts of impatient
yeomen, who leap over obstacles to pursue until recalled
to silence and to duty.</p>

<p>Staggering but reviving, grand in the glory of their
manhood, heroic in the fortitude which restores self-possession,
with a steady step, in the face of fire and
over the bodies of their dead, the remnant dare to renew
battle. Again the deadly volley; and the shattered
columns, in spite of entreaty or command, move
back to the place of starting, and the first shock of
battle is over.</p>

<p>A lifetime when it is past seems but as a moment!
A moment sometimes is as a lifetime. Onset and repulse!
Three hundred lifetimes ended in twenty
minutes!</p>

<h3>THE SARATOGA LESSON</h3>

<p class="center smaller">(From an Address delivered October 17, 1877.)</p>

<p class="author">BY GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS</p>

<p>The drama of the Revolution opened in New England,
culminated in New York, and closed in Virginia.
It was a happy fortune that the three colonies which
represented the various territorial sections of the settled
continent were each, in turn, the chief seat of war.
The common sacrifice, the common struggle, the common
triumph, tended to weld them locally, politically,
and morally together. Doubtless there were conflicts
of provincial pride and jealousy and suspicion. In
every great crisis of war, however, there was a common
impulse and devotion, and the welfare of the
continent obliterated provincial lines.</p>

<p>It is by the few heaven-piercing peaks, not by the
confused mass of upland, that we measure the height<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
of the Andes, of the Alps, of the Himalaya. It is by
Joseph Warren not by Benjamin Church, by John Jay
not by Sir John Johnson, by George Washington not
by Benedict Arnold, that we test the quality of the
Revolutionary character. The voice of Patrick Henry
from the mountains answered that of James Otis by
the sea. Paul Revere’s lantern shone along through
the valley of the Hudson, and flashed along the cliffs
of the Blue Ridge. The scattering volley of Lexington
green swelled to the triumphant thunder of Saratoga,
and the reverberation of Burgoyne’s falling arms
in New York shook those of Cornwallis in Virginia
from his hands. Doubts, jealousies, prejudices, were
merged in one common devotion. The union of the
colonies to secure liberty, foretold the union of the
States to maintain it, and wherever we stand on Revolutionary
fields, or inhale the sweetness of Revolutionary
memories, we tread the ground and breathe the air
of invincible national union.</p>

<p>So, upon this famous and decisive field, let every
unworthy feeling perish! Here, to the England that
we fought let us now, grown great and strong with a
hundred years, hold out the hand of fellowship and
peace! Here, where the English Burgoyne, in the
very moment of his bitter humiliation generously
pledged George Washington, let us, in our high hour
of triumph, of power, and of hope, pledge the queen!
Here, in the grave of brave and unknown foemen, may
mutual jealousies and doubts and animosities lie buried
forever! Henceforth, revering their common glorious
traditions, may England, and America press forward
side by side, in noble and inspiring rivalry to promote
the welfare of man!</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens, with the story of Burgoyne’s surrender,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
the Revolutionary glory of the State of New
York, still fresh in our memories, I am glad that the
hallowed spot on which we stand compels us to remember
not only the imperial State, but the national
Commonwealth, whose young hands here together
struck the blow, and on whose older head descends the
ample benediction of the victory. On yonder height,
a hundred years ago, Virginia and Pennsylvania lay
encamped. Beyond, and further to the north, watched
New Hampshire and Vermont. Here, in the wooded
uplands at the south, stood New Jersey and New York,
while across the river to the east, Connecticut and
Massachusetts closed the triumphant line. Here was
the symbol of the Revolution, a common cause, a common
strife, a common triumph; the cause, not of a
class, but of human nature; the triumph, not of a
colony, but of united America.</p>

<p>And we who stand here proudly remembering, we
who have seen Virginia and New York, the North and
the South, more bitterly hostile than the armies whose
battles shook this ground, we who mutually proved in
deadlier conflict the constancy and courage of all the
States, which, proud to be peers, yet own no master
but their united selves, we renew our heart’s imperishable
devotion to the common American faith, the common
American pride, the common American glory!
Here America stood and triumphed. Here Americans
stand and bless their memory. And here, for a thousand
years, many grateful generations of Americans
come to rehearse the glorious story, and to rejoice in a
supreme and benignant American nationality!</p>

<h3>THE SARATOGA MONUMENT BEGUN</h3>

<p class="author">BY HORATIO SEYMOUR</p>

<p class="center smaller">(From Address delivered October 17, 1877.)</p>

<p>One hundred years ago, on this spot, American independence
was made a great fact in the history of
nations. Until the surrender of the British army under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Burgoyne, the Declaration of Independence was
but a declaration. It was a patriotic purpose asserted
in bold words by brave men, who pledged for its maintenance
their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred
honor. But here it was made a fact by virtue of
armed force. It had been regarded by the world
merely as an act of defiance, but it was now seen that
it contained the germs of a government which the
event we celebrate made one of the powers of the
earth. Here rebellion was made revolution. Upon
this ground, that which had in the eye of the law been
treason, became triumphant patriotism. At the break
of day, in the judgment of the world, our fathers were
rebels. When the echoes of the evening gun died away
along this valley, they were patriots who had rescued
their country from wrong and outrage. We had
passed through the baptism of blood, and gained a
name among the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>Before the Revolution the people of the several colonies
held but little intercourse. They were estranged
from each other by distance, by sectional prejudices,
by differences of lineage and religious creeds. But
when the men of Virginia went to Massachusetts to
rescue Boston, when the men of the East and South
battled side by side with those from the Middle States,
when Greene and Lincoln went to the relief of the
Southern colonies, all prejudices not only died away,
but more than fraternal love animated every patriotic
heart from the bleak forests of New England to the
milder airs of Georgia. And now that a hundred
years have passed, and our country has become great
beyond the wildest dreams of our fathers, will not the
story of their sufferings revive in the breast of all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
love of our country, of our common country, and all
who live within its boundaries?</p>

<p>It was the most remarkable fact of the Revolutionary
War and of the formation of state and national
governments, that although the colonists were of different
lineages and languages, living under different
climates, with varied pursuits and forms of labor, cut
off from intercourse by distance, yet, in spite of all
these obstacles to accord, they were from the outset
animated by common views, feelings, and purposes.
When the independence was gained, they were able,
after a few weeks spent in consultation, to form the
constitution under which we have lived for nearly one
hundred years. There can be no stronger proof that
American institutions were born and shaped by American
necessities. This fact should give us new faith
in the lasting nature of our government.</p>

<p>Monuments make as well as mark the civilization of
a people. The surrender of Burgoyne marks the
dividing line between two conditions of our country:
the one the colonial period of dependence, and the
other the day from which it stood full-armed and victorious
here, endowed with a boldness to assert its independence,
and endowed with a wisdom to frame its
own system of government. We are told that during
more than twenty centuries of war and bloodshed, only
fifteen battles have been decisive of lasting results.
The contest of Saratoga is one of them. Shall not
some suitable structure recall this fact to the public
mind? Neither France, nor Britain, nor Germany
could spare the statues or works of art which keep
alive the memory of patriotic services or of personal
virtues. Such silent teachers of all that ennobles men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
have taught their lessons through the darkest ages, and
have done much to save society from sinking into utter
decay and degradation. If Greece or Rome had left
no memorials of private virtues or public greatness, the
progress of civilization would have been slow and
feeble. If their crumbling remains should be swept
away, the world would mourn the loss, not only to
learning and the arts, but to virtue and patriotism. It
concerns the honor and welfare of the American people
that this spot should be marked by some structure
which should recall its history and animate all, who
look upon it, by its grand teachings. No people ever
held lasting power or greatness who did not reverence
the virtues of their fathers, or who did not show forth
this reverence by material and striking testimonials.</p>

<p>Let us, then, build here, a lasting monument, which
shall tell of our gratitude to those who, through suffering
and sacrifice, wrought out the independence of
our country.</p>

<h3>THE SOUTH IN THE REVOLUTION</h3>

<p class="author">BY ROBERT YOUNG HAYNE</p>

<p>If there be one State in the Union, and I say it not
in a boasting spirit, that may challenge comparison
with any other, for an uniform, zealous, ardent, and uncalculating
devotion to the Union, that State is South
Carolina.</p>

<p>From the very commencement of the Revolution, up
to this hour, there is no sacrifice, however great, she
has not cheerfully made, no service she has even hesitated
to perform. She has adhered to you, in your
prosperity; but in your adversity she has clung to you
with more than filial affection. No matter what was
the condition of her domestic affairs, though deprived
of her resources, divided by parties, or surrounded by
difficulties, the call of the country has been to her as
the voice of God. Domestic discord ceased at the
sound; every man became at once reconciled to his
brethren, and the sons of Carolina were all seen crowding
together to the temple, bringing their gifts to the
altar of their common country.</p>

<p>What was the conduct of the South during the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
Revolution? I honor New England for her conduct
in that glorious struggle. But, great as is the praise
which belongs to her, I think at least equal honor is due
to the South. They espoused the quarrel of their
brethren with a generous zeal which did not suffer
them to stop to calculate their interest in the dispute.
Favorites of the mother-country, possessed of neither
ships nor seamen to create a commercial rivalship,
they might have found, in their situation, a guarantee
that their trade would be forever fostered and protected
by Great Britain. But, trampling on all considerations,
either of interest or of safety, they rushed
into the conflict; and, fighting for principle, periled all
in the sacred cause of freedom. Never was there exhibited
in the history of the world higher examples of
noble daring, dreadful suffering, and heroic endurance
than by the Whigs of Carolina during the Revolution!
The whole state, from the mountains to the sea, was
overrun by an overwhelming force of the enemy. The
fruits of industry perished on the spot where they were
produced, or were consumed by the foe. The “Plains
of Carolina” drank up the most precious blood of her
citizens. Black and smoking ruins marked the places
which had been the habitations of her children. Driven
from their homes, into the gloomy and almost impenetrable
swamps, even there the spirit of liberty survived,
and South Carolina, sustained by the example of her
Sumters and her Marions, proved, by her conduct, that,
though her soil might be overrun, the spirit of her
people was invincible.</p>

<h3>NEW ENGLAND AND VIRGINIA</h3>

<p class="author">BY ROBERT CHARLES WINTHROP</p>

<p>There are circumstances of peculiar and beautiful
correspondence in the careers of Virginia and New
England which must ever constitute a bond of sympathy,
affection, and pride between their children. Not
only did they form respectively the great northern and
southern rallying points of civilization on this continent;
not only was the most friendly competition or
the most cordial coöperation, as circumstances allowed,
kept up between them during their early colonial existence—but
who forgets the generous emulation, the
noble rivalry, with which they continually challenged
and seconded each other in resisting the first beginnings
of British aggression, in the persons of their
James Otises and Patrick Henrys?</p>

<p>Who forgets that while that resistance was first
brought to a practical test in New England, at Lexington
and Concord and Bunker Hill, Fortune reserved
for Yorktown of Virginia the last crowning battle of
Independence? Who forgets that while the hand by
which the original Declaration of Independence was
drafted, was furnished by Virginia, the tongue by
which the adoption of that instrument was defended
and secured, was furnished by New England,—a bond
of common glory, upon which not Death alone seemed
to set his seal, but Deity, I had almost said, to affix
an immortal sanction, when the spirits by which that
hand and voice were moved, were caught up together
to the clouds on the same great Day of the Nation’s
Jubilee.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And leaping squirrels, wandering brooks, and winds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That shake the leaves, and scatter, as they pass,</div>

<h3>AMERICA FIRST<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></h3>

<p class="author">ANONYMOUS</p>

<p>This is the season when Young America celebrates
the glorious deeds of the forefathers, when
they cut the leading-strings that bound them to the
Old World, and stepped forth with the independence
of manhood.</p>

<p>It took Rome five hundred years, five centuries of
war, intrigue and arrogance, to overspread Southern
Europe. In a little more than one century America
has grown to a magnitude in area and perhaps in population
also, equal to that of Rome in its most magnificent
days.</p>

<p>“<i>Civis Romanus sum!</i>” was the proudest boast that
could fall from the lips of man at the beginning of the
Christian era. Is there to-day an American who rates
his citizenship in the Great Republic at a lower value
than Roman freedom nineteen hundred years ago?</p>

<p>The day for “spread-eagle” brag is long past, but
there is no reason why we should hesitate to say what
not we alone but all the people of the world believe,
that it is the destiny of this country to become the
greatest, the strongest, the wealthiest, the most self-supporting
of all the nations of the earth. It is already
the greatest self-governing community the world
has ever seen.</p>

<p>How can we make it greater? By standing together
as Americans. We shall not magnify, but shall
belittle ourselves, if we swagger before our neighbors—using
bravado for the strong, and insolence in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
our treatment of the weak. But we should take
American views instead of party views, when questions
arise between this government and others.</p>

<p>The motto “America against the world” would be
a contemptible motto. Yet is it not better to adopt
even such a motto than to take the side of the world
against America, or to be indifferent when the interests
of one’s own country are assailed?</p>

<p>The Fourth of July is a good time for us all to
resolve that we will be Americans at heart. Not that
we will build up our own country on the ruins of
others, but that when there is a clashing of interests
those of our native land shall have our hearty support.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Know this, O man! whate’er thy earthly fate—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">God never made a tyrant nor a slave:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Woe, then, to those who dare to desecrate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His glorious image!—for to all He gave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eternal rights, which none may violate;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, by a mighty hand, the oppressed He yet shall save!</div>

<h3>A RHAPSODY</h3>

<p class="author">BY CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY</p>

<p>I may be an enthusiast; but I cannot but give utterance
to the conceptions of my own mind. When
I look upon the special developments of European
civilization; when I contemplate the growing freedom
of the cities, and the middle class which has sprung
up between the pretenders to divine rule on the one
hand, and the abject serf on the other; when I consider
the Reformation, and the invention of the press,
and see, on the southern shore of the continent, an
humble individual, amidst untold difficulties and repeated
defeats, pursuing the mysterious suggestions
which the mighty deep poured unceasingly upon his
troubled spirit, till at last, with great and irrepressible
energy of soul, he discovered that there lay in the
far western ocean a continent open for the infusion
of those elementary principles of liberty which were
dwarfed in European soil,—I conceive that the hand
of destiny was there!</p>

<p>When I see the immigration of the Pilgrims from
the chalky shores of England,—in the night fleeing
from their native home,—so dramatically and ably
pictured by Mr. Webster in his celebrated oration,—when
father, mother, brother, wife, sister, lover, were
all lost by those melancholy wanderers—“stifling,”
in the language of one who is immortal in the conception,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
“the mighty hunger of the heart,” and landing,
amidst cold and poverty and death, upon the rude
rocks of Plymouth,—I venture to think the will of
Deity was there!</p>

<p>When I have remembered the Revolution of ’76,—the
Seven Years’ War—three millions of men in
arms against the most powerful nation in history, and
vindicating their independence,—I have thought that
their sufferings and death were not in vain! When
I have seen the forsaken hearthstone,—looked upon
the battle-field, upon the dying and the dead,—heard
the agonizing cry, “Water, for the sake of God!
water;” seeing the dissolution of being—pale lips
pressing in death the yet loved images of wife, sister,
lover,—I have not deemed—I will not deem all
these things in vain! I cannot regard this great continent,
reaching from the Atlantic to the far Pacific,
and from the St. John’s to the Rio del Norte, as the
destined home of a barbarian people of third-rate
civilization.</p>

<p>Like the Roman who looked back upon the glory of
his ancestors, in woe, exclaiming,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Great Scipio’s ghost complains that we are slow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Pompey’s shade walks unavenged among us,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the great dead hover around me:—Lawrence, “Don’t
give up the ship.”—Henry, “Give me liberty or give
me death!”—Adams, “Survive or perish, I am for
the Declaration.”—Allan, “In the name of the living
God, I come!”</p>

<p>Come then, Thou Eternal, who dwellest not in
temples made with hands, but who, in the city’s crowd
or by the far forest stream, revealest Thyself to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
earnest seeker after the true and right, inspire my
heart; give me undying courage to pursue the promptings
of my spirit; and whether I shall be called in the
shades of life to look upon as sweet and kind and
lovely faces as now, or shut in by sorrow and night,
horrid visions shall gloom upon me in my dying hour,
O my country, mayest thou yet be free!</p>

<h3>A RENAISSANCE OF PATRIOTISM<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></h3>

<p class="author">BY GEORGE J. MANSON</p>

<h4>A RENAISSANCE</h4>

<p>Within the past few years there has been what ex-President
Harrison once happily termed “a renaissance
of patriotism.” It started with the centennial
anniversaries of 1776, which had the effect of carrying
the memories of the people back to the period of
the Nation’s birth, and subsequently resulted in the
formation of several societies which will be the means
of fostering the patriotic spirit and love of country,
and recall remembrances of our Revolutionary struggle.
The organizers of these societies found that there
was a growing lack of what may be called national patriotism—the
patriotism that grows out of a lively
recollection of the early making of the country through
battle, toil, and hardship of the fathers. This lukewarm
spirit was not charged to the flood of immigration,
or to the lapse of time, but was principally due<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
to neglect on the part of the descendants of Revolutionary
heroes to perform their duty of keeping before
the public mind the memory of the services of
their ancestors, the times in which they lived and the
principles for which they contended.</p>

<h4>THE SONS OF THE REVOLUTION</h4>

<p>One of the first of these societies to be started was
the “Sons of the Revolution.” This was organized
February 22, 1876, reorganized December 4, 1883, and
incorporated May 3, 1884. The aim of this society
is to perpetuate the memory of the men who, in military,
naval or civil service, by their acts or counsel,
achieved American independence. The members promote
and assist in the proper celebration of the anniversaries
of Washington’s Birthday, the battles of
Lexington and Bunker Hill, the Fourth of July, the
capitulation of Saratoga and Yorktown, and the
formal evacuation of New York by the British army,
December 3, 1783, as a relinquishment of territorial
sovereignty, and other prominent events relating to or
connected with the War of the Revolution.</p>

<p>The roll-book of the members is something more
than a mere list of names. Before each name is the
year, showing when the member was admitted into the
society, and there is also given in a paragraph his
genealogical history so far as it relates to his ancestors
who were in any way connected with the Revolutionary
struggle. There is a general, or national society, divided
into state societies which regulate their own
affairs. Under the rules of the New York State society,
ten or more members can organize within any
county outside of the county of New York, such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
body being called a local chapter. The total membership
is now about six thousand. When membership
is asked on the ground of an ancestor having been
a “sailor” or “marine,” it must be shown that such
service was other than shore duty and regularly performed
in the Continental navy, or the navy of one
of the original thirteen states, or on an armed vessel
other than a merchant ship. When the ancestor has
been an “official” his service must have been sufficiently
important in character to have rendered him
specially liable to arrest and imprisonment, if captured
by the enemy, as well as liable to conviction of treason
against the Government of Great Britain.</p>

<p>A few years ago the society stimulated interest in
its work by offering two prizes to the cadets of the
United States Naval Academy, at Annapolis, Md.,—a
gold medal and a silver medal—for the best original
essays upon the subject, “The Navy of the Revolution.”
A singular and patriotic feature of these essays
was that they were not to contain less than 1,776
words. A gold medal is likewise annually awarded
by the New York society to a student in the College
of the City of New York, for the best essay on a
patriotic subject, and gold, silver, and bronze medals
to the scholars of the high schools throughout the State
for like essays. Similar prizes are awarded by the
societies in other states.</p>

<p>Congress has also been urged, by the Sons of the
Revolution as a body, to pass a bill which has already
been introduced in that body, making an appropriation
of a sum of money to erect a monument to John
Paul Jones. It has also memorialized Congress to
enact such a law as will secure the publication of all
the archives of the United States Government relating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
to the War of the Revolution, in a manner similar to
the publication of the records of the War of the Rebellion.</p>

<p>The seal of the society is an interesting study, suggesting
as it does, in small compass, the spirit of
patriotism the society desires to cultivate. The seal
consists of the figure of a minute-man, in Continental
uniform, standing on a ladder leading to a belfry. In
his right hand he holds a musket and an olive branch,
while his left hand grasps a bell-rope. Above is seen
the cracked Liberty bell, from which issues a ribbon
bearing the motto of the society: <i>Exegi monumentum
aere perennius</i>. Many members of this society did
gallant service in the war with Spain.</p>

<h4>SONS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION</h4>

<p>The second important patriotic society is the “Sons
of the American Revolution,” a name very similar
to that of the organization just mentioned. The first
branch of this society was formed in California in
1876 by a body of descendants of officers, soldiers,
and seamen of the Revolution gathered in San Francisco
for the purpose of celebrating the one hundredth
anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.
Similar societies were therefore organized in other
states and, on April 30, 1889, these societies with two
or three exceptions celebrated the centennial inauguration
of Washington as first President of the United
States. This meeting was held in Fraunce’s Tavern,
in New York City, in the identical long room (now
marked with a commemorative tablet) in which
Washington bade farewell to his officers, December 3,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
1783. The national organization was formed on the
occasion of this meeting.</p>

<p>This society exists in about thirty states, and numbers
about five thousand members. A singular and interesting
feature in connection with this and kindred
organizations is that their existence has led to and
greatly stimulated genealogical research, a species of
investigation to which Americans, as a rule, have
given but little attention. Persons who have become
interested in these societies, it has been found, have
rescued unrecorded facts from the aged members of
their families who were destined soon to pass away,
information which could have been obtained in no
other way and which would have been lost forever in
a few years.</p>

<p>The “Sons of the American Revolution” prides itself
on being a practical and not merely a sentimental
and ornamental organization. It has been particularly
active in saving throughout the country valuable historical
landmarks, such as the headquarters of Jonathan
Trumbull, in Connecticut, which has been obtained
and is now used for a museum. It is marking
historical spots and, directly and indirectly, securing
the erection of memorials of the Revolutionary heroes,
such as the Bennington Monument, near that famous
battle-field, the statue of Gen. John Stark, in New
Hampshire, and a monument to be erected in Baltimore
to Maryland’s heroes of the Revolution. It has
obtained from Congress a law providing for the collection
and indexing of the records of service of the
Revolution. It has stimulated the general observance
of national patriotic holidays, and was influential in
setting apart June 14th as “Flag Day” in commemoration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
of the adoption of the Stars and Stripes as the
national standard.</p>

<h4>THE SOCIETY OF COLONIAL WARS</h4>

<p>“The Society of Colonial Wars,” originated in New
York, and was instituted August 18, 1892, and incorporated
October 18, 1892. In May, 1893, the New
York society with the societies in the states of Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and the
District of Columbia organized the general society,
these states, having been previously chartered by the
society in the State of New York. The objects of the
organizations are similar to those of the previously
named societies, from which they differ only in minor
details. The present membership is approximately
3,000. On June 14th of this year (1898) this society
joined with the Sons of the Revolution in appropriate
ceremonies attending the unveiling of commemorative
tablets at Fort Ticonderoga, intended to perpetuate
the memories of the capture of the fort by
Colonel Ethan Allen and his gallant band, the Colonial
battles fought in the vicinity of Fort Ticonderoga, etc.</p>

<h4>THE MILITARY ORDER OF FOREIGN WARS</h4>

<p>“The Military Order of Foreign Wars” is, as its
name implies, a military organization with patriotic
objects, having for its scope the period of American
history since national independence. The principal
feature of the order is the perpetuating of the names,
as well as the services, of commissioned officers who
served in either the War of the Revolution, the War
with Tripoli, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
the War with Spain. Veteran Companionship is conferred
upon such officers, and Hereditary Companionship
upon their direct lineal descendants in the male
line. The present membership is 1,400, which is
rapidly growing. Other societies that merit more extended
notice but which can here only be named are
the “Order of Cincinnati,” the “Society of the War
of 1812,” the “Aztec Club,” the “Loyal Legion,” the
“Grand Army of the Republic,” the “Flag Association,”
“Colonial Order of the Acorn,” “Order of
Washington,” the “Pilgrim Society,” and some others.</p>

<h4>THE DAUGHTERS OF THE REVOLUTION</h4>

<p>It is quite natural that women, whose patriotic services
during the late Civil War have often been the subject
of grateful eulogy, should become interested in
this new movement. There are several patriotic societies,
composed exclusively of women, the objects
of which are practically the same as the organizations
which have just been mentioned. The society known
as the “Daughters of the Revolution” was organized
by Mrs. Flora Adams Darling, September 9, 1891.
In October, 1890, was organized the more important
society known as the “Daughters of the American
Revolution,” which now has a membership of about
3,500. This society has state chapters existing in most
of the states. To become a member of this society a
woman must be not less than eighteen years of age,
and be the descendant of an ancestor who loyally
rendered material aid as a soldier, sailor or civil officer
to the cause of independence. The Daughters
of the American Revolution have presented to the City
of Paris an equestrian statue of Lafayette designed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
and executed by Daniel C. French. It was intended
to be a return of the compliment to the American
people conveyed by the French Government when it
presented to the United States the statue of Washington
which is now at the National Capital. The unveiling
took place with imposing ceremonies on July
3rd.</p>

<h4>THE COLONIAL DAMES OF AMERICA</h4>

<p>The “Colonial Dames of America,” an organization
incorporated in 1893, requires of a member that
she shall be descended in her own right from some ancestor
of worthy life who came to reside in the
American colony prior to 1750. This ancestor, or
some one of his descendants, shall be a lineal ascendant
of the applicant, and shall have rendered efficient
service to his country during the colonial period
either in the founding of the commonwealth, or of
an institution which has survived and developed into
importance, or who shall have held an important position
in the Colonial Government and by distinguished
services shall have contributed to the founding of the
Nation. Services rendered after 1783 are not recognized.</p>

<h4>UNITED STATES DAUGHTERS, 1776-1812</h4>

<p>Still another woman’s patriotic organization is
known as the “United States Daughters, 1776-1812.”
This society was founded by Mrs. Flora Adams Darling,
and incorporated in 1892. Ladies to be eligible
must be lineal descendants of an ancestor who assisted
in the wars of 1776-1812, either as a military or naval
officer, soldier, sailor, or in any way gave aid to the
cause, tho’ the society reserves to itself the privilege<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
of rejecting any nomination that may not be acceptable
to it.</p>

<p>Another patriotic woman’s organization tho’ not of
recent date, which has for years rendered important
service, is the “Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association,”
of Washington, D. C. This association has under its
care and direction the Washington estate at Mount
Vernon, Va. In 1895 a volume entitled “Ancestry”
was published by Bailey, Banks and Biddle (Philadelphia)
in connection with their Department of Heraldry
that contained a complete list of the various patriotic
societies, then forty-seven in number. Since
the publication of this volume many new societies
have sprung up.</p>

<h3>LIBERTY AND UNION ONE AND INSEPARABLE</h3>

<p class="author">BY DANIEL WEBSTER</p>

<p>I profess, sir, in my career hitherto, to have kept
steadily in view the prosperity and honor of the whole
country, and the preservation of our Federal Union.
It is to that Union that we owe our safety at home, and
our consideration and dignity abroad. It is to that
Union that we are chiefly indebted for whatever makes
us most proud of our country. That Union we
reached only by the discipline of our virtues, in the
severe school of adversity. It had its origin in the
necessities of disordered finance, prostrate commerce,
and ruined credit. Under its benign influences these
great interests immediately awoke, as from the dead,
and sprang forth with newness of life. Every year
of its duration has teemed with fresh proofs of its
utility and its blessings; and, although our territory has
stretched out wider and wider, and our population
spread farther and farther, they have not outrun its
protection or its benefits. It has been to us all a
copious fountain of national, social, and personal happiness.
I have not allowed myself, sir, to look beyond
the Union, to see what might lie hidden in the dark<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
recess behind. I have not coolly weighed the chances
of preserving liberty, when the bonds that unite us
together shall be broken asunder. I have not accustomed
myself to hang over the precipice of disunion, to
see whether, with my short sight, I can fathom the
depth of the abyss below; nor could I regard him as a
safe counselor in the affairs of this government, whose
thought should be mainly bent on considering, not how
the Union may be best preserved, but how tolerable
might be the condition of the people when it should be
broken up and destroyed.</p>

<p>While the Union lasts, we have high, exciting, gratifying
prospects spread out before us, for us and our
children. Beyond that I seek not to penetrate the
veil. God grant that in my day, at least, that curtain
may not rise! God grant that on my vision never
may be opened what lies behind! When my eyes
shall be turned to behold, for the last time, the sun
in heaven, may I not see him shining on the broken
and dishonored fragments of a once glorious Union; on
States dissevered, discordant, belligerent; on a land
rent with civil feuds, or drenched, it may be, in fraternal
blood!</p>

<p>Let their last feeble and lingering glance rather behold
the gorgeous ensign of the republic, now known
and honored throughout the earth, still full high advanced,
its arms and trophies streaming in their
original luster, not a stripe erased or polluted, nor a
single star obscured; bearing for its motto no such
miserable interrogatory as, <i>What is all this worth?</i> nor
those other words of delusion and folly,—<i>Liberty first
and Union afterwards</i>; but everywhere, spread all over
in characters of living light, blazing on all its ample
folds as they float over the sea and over the land, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
in every wind under the whole heavens, that other sentiment,
dear to every true American heart,—<i>Liberty</i>
and <i>Union</i>, <i>now</i> and <i>forever</i>, <i>one</i> and <i>inseparable</i>!</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Built by no mercenary, vulgar hand,</div>

<h3>HOROLOGE OF LIBERTY</h3>

<p>The world heard: the battle of Lexington—one;
the Declaration of Independence—two; the surrender

the treaty of Paris—five; the inauguration of Washington—six;
and then it was the sunrise of a new

<h3>THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC</h3>

<p class="author">BY GEORGE BANCROFT</p>

<p>In the fullness of time, a Republic rose up in the
wilderness of America. Thousands of years had
passed away before this child of the ages could be born.
From whatever there was of good in the systems of
former centuries she drew her nourishment; the
wrecks of the past were her warnings. With the
deepest sentiment of faith fixed in her inmost nature,
she disenthralled religion from bondage to temporal
power, that her worship might be worship only in
spirit and in truth.</p>

<p>The wisdom which had passed from India through
Greece, with what Greece had added of her own; the
jurisprudence of Rome; the mediæval municipalities;
the Teutonic method of representation, the political experience
of England, the benignant wisdom of the expositors
of the law of nature and of nations in France
and Holland, all shed on her their selectest influence.
She washed the gold of political wisdom from the
sands wherever it was found; she cleft it from the
rocks; she gleaned it among ruins. Out of all the discoveries
of statesmen and sages, out of all the experience
of past human life, she compiled a perennial political
philosophy, the primordial principles of national
ethics.</p>

<p>The wise men of Europe sought the best government
in a mixture of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy;
and America went behind these names to extract from
them the vital elements of social forms, and blend them
harmoniously in the free Commonwealth, which comes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
nearest to the illustration of the natural equality of
all men. She entrusted the guardianship of established
rights to law; the movements of reform to the spirit
of the people, and drew her force from the happy
reconciliation of both.</p>

<h3>JIM’S AUNT</h3>

<p class="author">BY FRANCES BENT DILLINGHAM</p>

<p>“I wish you could take him in,” the minister said,
almost entreatingly. “He isn’t a bad boy, you know;
his family is quite respectable; but when his aunt said
she couldn’t afford to take him into the country with
her children, it seemed too bad for him to stay in the
city.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course,” Miss Lucinda assented hastily.
“If only he wasn’t a boy!”</p>

<p>The minister sighed. “I want you to do what you
think best.”</p>

<p>It was Miss Lucinda’s turn to sigh now—a long-drawn
breath of surrender. “Well, I’ll take him,”
she said.</p>

<p>The minister rose to go. “It’s very kind of you,
Miss Tarbox; be sure I appreciate your self-sacrifice;”
and then he added, in a hesitating sort of way, “You
are always full of good works.”</p>

<p>The color flamed up in Miss Lucinda’s face. “Oh!”
she exclaimed, lifting her proud head still higher, “I
don’t do anything!” and the minister felt the usual
sense of defeat he experienced in Miss Tarbox’s
presence.</p>

<p>He was quite dejected as he went down the garden
walk. “So excellent a woman,” he murmured to himself,
and he mournfully contrasted her uncompromising
manner with the flattering air of other single ladies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
of his parish as he glanced back furtively toward her
parlor window.</p>

<p>But Miss Tarbox would have considered it unpardonable
coquetry to peep after the minister, since he
was an unmarried man, and she an eligible if not youthful
spinster, so she went at once into the kitchen to
prepare her supper. But the color did not at once fade
from her cheeks as she moved about in her rapid,
methodical manner, and she thought not so much of
the boy who was to come, as of the man who had just
gone. If the minister felt overcome in Miss Lucinda’s
presence, she, too, had a similar feeling after he had
left her with some unspoken word on his lips.</p>

<p>“It seems as though he was going to say something
sometimes, but I kill it out of him. I wonder what is
the matter with me, anyway?” Miss Lucinda had acquired
a habit of talking to herself, and now nodded
gravely to her reflection in the little mirror over the
kitchen shelf. “I’m not bad-looking and I mean to
be pleasant, but, somehow most folks seem kind of
afraid of me. I s’pose I have an up-and-coming way
with me that scares most of them. I don’t seem to be
the sort they take to; though I must say it’s forlorn
to be that way,” and the image in the mirror sighed
audibly.</p>

<p>When Miss Lucinda had seated herself at her lonely
tea-table, her thoughts took another channel. “What
in the world am I to do with a boy? He’ll upset
things on the table-cloth, and let flies in the house and
rub his fingers on the window-pane, and holler. Well,
there’s one thing about it, he’s got to mind every word
I say to him!” But here Miss Lucinda drew herself
up with a jerk. “There you go, Lucinda, complaining
of your loneliness, and then finding fault when someone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
comes to see you; thinking you’re too fond of
running things, and then saying you’re going to make
this boy do just as you want him to.”</p>

<p>It was only a few days later when the boy came, in
company with the minister. He was not so large a
boy as Miss Lucinda had expected from his age, and
he was rather thin and pale.</p>

<p>“I’ll give him enough to eat, that’s one thing,” she
told the minister. “And I’ve been thinking there’s
one comfort in a boy: he doesn’t talk so much as a
girl—that is, he isn’t likely to.”</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t likely to,” the minister assented, a little
doubtfully.</p>

<p>After the minister had gone, Miss Lucinda began to
wonder what she should do with the boy the rest of the
morning. She found him in the kitchen, his short legs
stretched to their utmost, trying to capture two flies
buzzing on the window-pane. He paused in his exertions,
and turned on her with a beaming smile.</p>

<p>“Hullo! Is dinner ready?” he asked.</p>

<p>Miss Lucinda drew herself up. “We don’t have
dinner till twelve o’clock,” she said frigidly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right; you needn’t hurry,” the boy
said pleasantly. “I’m kinder grub-struck, but I guess
I kin wait.”</p>

<p>Miss Lucinda stared at him in rebuke. “Perhaps
you’d better go out and play,” she suggested, “while
I get dinner;” and off he went.</p>

<p>When the dinner-table was laid, Miss Lucinda rang
her seldom-used bell out of the back door, and the boy
came in promptly, with quite a color in his cheeks.</p>

<p>“My!” he exclaimed, staring at the neat, plentiful
table, “ain’t this a feed!”</p>

<p>“You’d better go and wash your hands,” Miss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
Lucinda suggested, and the boy went cheerily to the
sink, scrubbing himself vigorously and then wiping his
hands on the spick-and-span roller. Miss Lucinda
groaned at the great black marks on the towel, and
went out into the kitchen to turn it about so that she
might not have to look at them through the dining-room
doorway.</p>

<p>“Mercy on us!” she cried in distress as she came
out into the kitchen, “you’ve left the door open. The
house’ll be full of flies!”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t you trouble,” the boy said soothingly.
“I’ll catch every single fly that’s got in. I’m a great
flycatcher, I am. I’m used to flies.”</p>

<p>At the table, conversation did not at all flourish.
Miss Lucinda had heard of a boy’s appetite, but she
had never dreamed of such awful capacity as this
young person displayed. After he had taken the first
keen edge from his hunger he laid down his knife and
fork and looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Should you mind if I was to call you aunt?” he
asked smilingly. “You know I useter live with my
aunt, and I’m kinder useter sayin’ it.”</p>

<p>“I think it would be better if you called me Miss
Tarbox,” Miss Lucinda said, surprised, but not thrown
off her guard.</p>

<p>“That’s rather long,” the boy said meditatively;
“but I guess if I say it often enough I kin git it Miss
Tarbox, Misstarbox, Misstubox, Misstibox, Miss—”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that over again, for goodness’ sake,”
Miss Lucinda said irritably. “What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Well, the whole of it is James Wilson, but I guess
you’d better call me Jim. I’m useter that.”</p>

<p>“What did you do this morning?” Miss Tarbox<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
felt called upon to sustain and direct further conversation.</p>

<p>“I went over to see the boy ’cross the street and
we’re goin’ to play Indian this afternoon. Did you
ever play Indian?”</p>

<p>Miss Tarbox shook her head.</p>

<p>“You stick feathers all ’round your hat, and you
make a fire and roast potatoes, and yell and eat the
potatoes. That boy is a mighty nice feller. I told
him I was stoppin’ with you and goin’ to have a dandy
time. I guess he don’t know you very well. I told
him I thought you was kinder hard to git acquainted
with. He said we’d git our feathers out o’ his hen-yard,
and I thought p’r’aps I might bring the potatoes.
Do you think you could let me have two potatoes? I
won’t eat quite so much next time.”</p>

<p>Miss Lucinda drew a long breath. “Yes,” she said,
“I’ll let you have the potatoes.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s real nice. I told him I thought you’d
be willin’.”</p>

<p>As soon as dinner was over Miss Lucinda brought
the two potatoes from the cellar, but the boy did not
go at once; he sat on a chair in the kitchen, and watched
her brisk movements as she cleared the table and made
ready to wash the dishes.</p>

<p>“Say, you’re awful smart, ain’t you?” he asked
after a moment of observation, and Miss Tarbox,
somewhat overwhelmed did not reply.</p>

<p>He placed his elbow on his round knee and his
chin on his small hand and stared a few moments in
silence.</p>

<p>“It looks awful kinder nice the way you hold up
your head. Now, my aunt, she kinder slumps along.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
She’s a real nice woman, you know, but she don’t look’s
though she had much gumption.”</p>

<p>Another silence.</p>

<p>“Say, what kin I do?” he asked next.</p>

<p>“Mercy on us!” ejaculated Miss Lucinda, “don’t
ask me. I thought you were going to roast potatoes.”</p>

<p>“I thought p’r’aps you might be kinder lonesome all
alone, and I’d jest as soon help you wash up. I’m
useter it. I kin make beds and sweep and wash dishes
and do lots o’ things. Try me and see.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I can get along very well; you needn’t
help,” Miss Lucinda said in grim accents of dismissal
but the boy did not move.</p>

<p>“I s’pose you’re pretty busy,” he ventured presently.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, rather,” Miss Lucinda answered shortly.</p>

<p>“Do you usually have a real good time Fourth o’
July?” he went on.</p>

<p>Miss Lucinda gasped. “Well, no. I can’t say I
do,” she answered in mournful truthfulness.</p>

<p>“Now that’s funny,” the boy said, in a surprised
tone. “Seem’s though the country’d be an awful nice
place to have a good time in, Fourth o’ July. Mebbe
it’s ’cause you never had nobody to cel’brate with; but
you will this year. You’ll have a real nice time, too;
I always enjoy Fourth o’ July.”</p>

<p>Miss Lucinda gave a feeble sigh. “What do you
usually do Fourth o’ July?” she asked, with the desire
to learn her coming fate.</p>

<p>“Well, last year I had one bunch o’ firecrackers
that got fired off the very first thing. I thought mebbe
this year I’d earn ’nough money to buy two bunches;
d’you think I could?”</p>

<p>“Well, really, I don’t know,” Miss Lucinda said.</p>

<p>“And last year I went to see the percession, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
crowd jammed me, and I didn’t see nothin’; but this
year they’re goin’ to have a percession out here, and
that feller asked me to be in it. D’you suppose I
could?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Miss Lucinda answered again.</p>

<p>“They’re goin’ to have reg’lar uniforms, red, white,
and blue”—evidently the boy took this as half consent—“and
it’s goin’ to be jest great. I s’pose it’d be a
good deal o’ trouble to make me a uniform, seein’s
you’re so busy?”</p>

<p>“A soldier suit? Dear me, yes, I should say so!”
There was no doubt now in Miss Lucinda’s tones.</p>

<p>The boy drew a deep breath as he rose to go. “All
right,” he said cheerfully, “I’ll tell the fellers; p’r’aps
they’ll let me march, jest the same.”</p>

<p>When supper-time came and Miss Lucinda rang her
bell again out the door, she saw the boy coming along
the path from the barn, helping Joshua, the man-of-all-work,
bring in the brimming pail of milk.</p>

<p>“Supper is ready,” Miss Lucinda said, and this time
the boy washed his hands without special order.</p>

<p>“Say,” he cried, waving the roller, “Josh’s goin’ to
teach me how to milk, and you won’t have to hire him
any more. I kin do everything’s well as not, can’t I,
Josh?” But Joshua had, fortunately, gone and did not
hear this threat to usurp his position.</p>

<p>“Well, you do have orful good meals,” he said, sitting
down opposite Miss Lucinda’s handsome, severe
figure. “I’m orful hungry, but I did have the dandiest
time to-day you ever heard of. The potatoes didn’t
roast very well, but the fire burned like fun. My
Jiminy—”</p>

<p>“James!” called Miss Lucinda in an awful voice.</p>

<p>James opened his innocent eyes and looked at her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
then fell to eating with renewed vigor, and it was some
time before he mustered courage to finish his recital.</p>

<p>But when he came out into the kitchen and watched
her moving back and forth in the dusky light, Miss
Lucinda somehow felt herself moved to open conversation.</p>

<p>“You didn’t eat so very much for supper, James.”</p>

<p>“No, marm,” James answered promptly. “Don’t
you remember them potatoes? I was a-payin’ for
’em.”</p>

<p>“Mercy on us!” cried Miss Lucinda, and she went
to the dining-room and brought from the table the currant
pie, of which the boy, to Miss Lucinda’s amazement,
had eaten only two pieces.</p>

<p>He ate the third generous slice she gave him, and
again sat still, watching her with round, admiring eyes
as she moved about.</p>

<p>“I think it’s about time for you to go to bed now,
James,” his guardian said presently, and James rose
promptly.</p>

<p>“Would you mind calling me Jim? It sounds
kinder homesick to be called James,” he said, with sudden
wistfulness engendered, even in his boyish spirit,
by the shadows and the newness of the place.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Jim,” Miss Lucinda responded; but
Jim still stood looking at her with serious eyes.</p>

<p>“My aunt useter kiss me good-night. You don’t
exactly look like the kissin’ kind, and I ain’t neither,
but—but I didn’t know, seein’ ’s you’re so good to
me, but—p’r’aps”—he flushed and shifted himself
from one foot to the other.</p>

<p>Miss Lucinda flushed, too, and looked greatly embarrassed,
but hers was no stony heart to refuse so
gallant a suitor; she stooped and kissed him awkwardly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
and flutteringly somewhere upon his forehead or hair;
but when she would have felt her duty over, he suddenly
seized her in an impetuous hug. He went upstairs
quickly, and Miss Lucinda sat down in her little
rocking-chair with hot, red cheeks, and something
deeper than embarrassment brought a new light into
her clear eyes.</p>

<p>“I think he tries hard to be a good boy,” Miss
Lucinda said to the minister when he next called, “but
he does a great many things that are rather startling,
and now and then he says something he oughtn’t to.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” the minister said, in kindly interest.</p>

<p>“The very first day he got here, he swore at the
table.” The minister looked horrified. “Of course I
spoke of it right off and he hasn’t done it again. He
was kind of excited about playing Indian, and I don’t
suppose he really meant it; he said”—the minister
reddened and looked away, and Miss Lucinda flushed—“he
said ‘Jiminy.’” The minister drew out his
handkerchief and coughed slightly. “But, as I say, he
hasn’t said anything since, and I think I could get along
very well if Fourth of July wasn’t coming so soon.
But what do you think? He wants a soldier suit, and
firecrackers, and all sorts of things. If only he hadn’t
come till after the Fourth! I never did approve of it.
I always did think it was a heathenish holiday,” and
Miss Lucinda broke off feelingly.</p>

<p>After the minister had gone Miss Lucinda started
to go to the village store. Jim usually did the errands,
but this was something that had been overlooked, and
he was at play, out of calling distance.</p>

<p>On Miss Lucinda’s return, as she came through the
lane by a shorter road, she heard voices in the field
beyond; the speakers were hidden by a hedge, but she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
recognized the tones as Jim’s and his playfellow’s
across the street.</p>

<p>“Say, can’t you march?” said a wheedling voice.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” Jim’s voice answered, a trifle
dolefully.</p>

<p>“Why not? Won’t she make you a suit?”</p>

<p>There was a little pause before Jim answered:
“Well, I don’t know’s I care ’bout marchin’.”</p>

<p>“H’m! you needn’t say that. It’s cause that stingy
old maid won’t make you anything to wear, I know.”</p>

<p>There was a sudden movement on the other side of
the hedge. “You call her a stingy old maid again and
you’ll see! She’s a handsome lady, she is, and it ain’t
none o’ your business if I don’t want to march.”</p>

<p>“H’m! you needn’t git on your ear so dreadful
quick. I wouldn’t stand up for anybody that only let
me earn money enough to buy two bunches of firecrackers.
Why, I’ve got two packages! A great
Fourth o’ July you’ll have!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got some more money, but I ain’t goin’ to
buy firecrackers; I’m savin’ it for a s’prise. Say, look-a-here,
you see, Miss Tibbox ain’t never had a boy
’round, an’ she don’t understand ’bout Fourth o’ July,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>Miss Lucinda did not wait to hear the answer, but
went swiftly back to the village.</p>

<p>The night before the Fourth, as Jim was going to
bed, Miss Lucinda said: “Ain’t you going to march
with the boys to-morrow, Jim?”</p>

<p>Jim shook his head and looked at her solemnly. “I
ain’t got no suit. The fellers won’t let you march
without one. Never mind, I’ve given up lots of
things. My aunt wa’nt much of a hand for doin’
things, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>Jim had never asked Miss Lucinda to kiss him good-night
since that first time, when he felt so markedly
homesick, and certainly she would never have offered
to kiss him, so she merely said, as he took his light to
go upstairs, “Good-night, Jim.”</p>

<p>But she sat down in her rocking-chair, quite near
the dining-room door, with an expectant listening expression
on her face. Suddenly there arose a great
commotion above, and Jim came tumbling down the
stairs with wild shrieks of delight.</p>

<p>“Oh, my gracious! oh, my gracious!” he cried.
“Look-a-here, did you do it? Ain’t they butes? I
kin march now, can’t I? Oh, my Jimi—my gracious,
my gracious!” And he danced about the room, first
on one foot and then on the other, waving in one
hand a wonderful pair of red, white, and blue
trousers, in the other a similarly gorgeous jacket.</p>

<p>Miss Lucinda was really frightened; she was not
used to such demonstrations of joy. But Jim stopped
his dancing presently, and, throwing his cherished outfit
on the floor, he embraced her rapturously, until she
gravely extricated herself.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you like it, Jim,” she said a little
stiffly.</p>

<p>“Like it!” Jim shrieked, throwing himself about in
another wild pantomime. “Like it! Oh, my gracious,
I’m ’fraid I shall bust!”</p>

<p>“I think you had better go to bed now,” Miss
Lucinda said, after a pause.</p>

<p>Jim gathered up his suit and looked at her anxiously.
“Should you mind if I was to git up dreadful early,
if I didn’t wake you up?” he asked.</p>

<p>And Miss Lucinda, to her own amazement, found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
herself replying: “Well, no; but don’t get up too
early.”</p>

<p>And after Jim was asleep, and it was time for her
to retire, she went softly into his room to lay two
packages of firecrackers on the chair beside the gay
garments.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Lucinda hid her head under the bed-clothes
during the night, and when there came an
extra loud explosion thought of Jim. But at breakfast-time
he turned up safe and smiling.</p>

<p>“I never had sech a good time in all my life before.
Say, Miss Tibbox, did you mean all those firecrackers
for me? Well, if you ain’t the nicest woman
in the world! I’ve got a s’prise for you, too. Just
you wait and see!” and he nodded mysteriously across
the table at Miss Lucinda, who felt a vague misgiving.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you wear your soldier suit?” she
asked.</p>

<p>Jim beamed upon her. “Why, I’m a-savin’ it. We
don’t march till ten o’clock. You don’t know how
much nicer it is to be in a percession than jest to look
at it. I wish you could march, too,” he added politely.
“But you’ll come out on the piazza and watch us go
by, won’t you?”</p>

<p>And Miss Lucinda promised to be on the spot.</p>

<p>If Jim had never passed another such day, it was
as wholly unprecedented in Miss Lucinda Tarbox’s
calendar. Jim marched by the house as proud as a
peacock in his new soldier suit, and raised a cheer
to Miss Lucinda so loud and hearty that she retired
blushing into the house. Then after dinner there was
nothing for Miss Lucinda but to come out on the
piazza and watch Jim fire off some of his crackers;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
and there the poor lady sat cringing and shrinking
and trying to smile each time Jim would shout,
“That’s the loudest of all!”</p>

<p>But the climax of the day was reached when Jim
brought the minister home to supper. How it happened
that the minister appeared upon the scene at
tea-time, Miss Lucinda could not understand; but when
he arrived, and Jim whispered in a loud aside, “I
thought p’r’aps he might stay to supper,” there was
no alternative but a cordial invitation, which the
minister accepted promptly. Miss Lucinda likewise
never knew the remarks with which Jim escorted the
minister to the house. “She’s the very nicest woman
in the world,” he told the minister, “and I think she
thinks you’re a pretty nice sort of a chap.” The
minister never repeated these compliments of Jim’s to
Miss Lucinda.</p>

<p>After tea, Jim’s secret was revealed; he had invested
the larger part of his small earnings in fireworks,
which he was quite sure Miss Lucinda would
enjoy, and he had invited the minister to supper that
he might help him set them off. So Miss Lucinda
came out on the porch in the darkness, and the minister
and Jim paraded about in the neat little garden in
front, and proceeded to diminish Jim’s purchases.
Presently the minister came up on the piazza and sat
down beside Miss Lucinda, for the remaining fireworks
could easily be disposed of by Jim. But just
as the minister was considering whether the time was
propitious for an advancement of his own interests,
there came a sudden sharp cry from Miss Lucinda,
and he turned to see a line of flame running about
the paper belt of the gallant little showman. The
minister was quick in his movements, and was down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
the path and had Jim in his arms and the fire
smothered in a few moments, while Miss Lucinda was
by his side, sobbing and bending over Jim’s little
form.</p>

<p>“Oh, let me see him,” she cried; “the dear child!
Is he hurt very badly?”</p>

<p>Jim wriggled a little in the minister’s arms, and
opening his eyes, smiled on her. “Now don’t you
worry,” he said cheerily, “I ain’t hurt.”</p>

<p>“But I’m ’fraid I’ve spoilt my suit,” he added when
the minister had placed him on the lounge in Miss
Lucinda’s little sitting-room.</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind the suit!” Miss Lucinda cried, and
Jim looked up at her in reproachful surprise.</p>

<p>But it was quite true that he was not hurt, though
rather weak from the fright, and presently he came
out again, between the minister and Miss Lucinda, to
sit on the piazza and watch the neighbors’ fireworks.</p>

<p>Jim, on the little stool at Miss Lucinda’s feet, leaned
his head against her knee. “I don’t care, it’s been a
fine Fourth o’ July,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“So it has,” echoed the minister; “don’t you think
so, Lucinda?” But Miss Lucinda’s only answer was
a blush and a consenting silence.</p>

<p>“Do you mind now if I call you aunt?” Jim’s voice
asked.</p>

<p>Miss Lucinda laid her hand gently on Jim’s head.
“No, dear,” she said softly; “no.”</p>

<p>“You might call me uncle,” suggested the minister.</p>

<p>Jim nodded brightly. “All right,” he said promptly;
“then we’ll be a reg’lar family.”</p>

<p>And the new uncle and aunt smiled in the darkness.</p>

<h3>OUR BARBAROUS FOURTH</h3>

<p class="author">BY MRS. ISAAC L. RICE</p>

<p class="center smaller">(From <i>The Century Magazine</i>, June, 1908.)</p>

<p>In his first book, Marcus Aurelius gratefully acknowledges
his obligation to Sextus of Chæronea for
having taught him to “express approbation without
noisy display.” Alas! in all the centuries which have
elapsed since the time of this emperor-philosopher, we
have not yet learned to appreciate the wisdom of his
counsel; and every holiday, in our country, at least,
is made the occasion of a strident outburst of hoodlumism.
Hallowe’en, Election Day, Christmas, New
Year’s, Inauguration Day, and Fourth of July, each
witnesses our thoroughfares thronged with shouting
and disorderly crowds, provided with every noisy device
from the tin trumpet to the dangerous pistol,
while shrieks of whistles shrill maddeningly above the
street clamor and the booming of bells. Accidents
occur, the sick are made worse by these frenzied
demonstrations, and the young fail to appreciate the
significance of the day which is being so unbeautifully
celebrated.</p>

<p>Of all these “noise-fests,” the most shocking is the
Fourth of July, and its grim statistics probably furnish
a sadder commentary on human folly than that afforded
by any other celebration in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>I often wonder what would be the emotions of a
stranger, quite ignorant of our institutions, if he arrived
in our country—“God’s Country,” as we affectionately
call it—just before midsummer, and
glanced over our great newspapers. After reading
some items, such as the following, would he be apt
to await a great and glorious anniversary, or the advent
of a day of strife and terror?</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The horrible Fourth will soon be here.... In all
the big cities the Fourth of July is now looked forward
to with apprehension and looked back upon with a shudder,
and even with horror.</p>

</div>

<p>Or,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Board of Health has established supply stations of
tetanus antitoxin throughout the city. The National Volunteer
Emergency Service has established field dressing
stations in the thickly populated sections. The hospitals
also expect their usual busy day.</p>

</div>

<p>And then he would read head-lines like these:</p>

<p class="center">THE NATIONAL BATTLE-FIELD<br>
CARNAGE BEGINS ON HOLIDAY EVE<br>
BLOODIEST FOURTH YET<br>
DEATHS AND INJURIES IN FOURTH OF JULY’S WAKE</p>

<p>After our stranger had grasped the fact that this
was not the record of a battle or other public calamity,
but merely some details regarding the manner in which
a great nation commemorates the most solemn event
in its history, I doubt whether he would have an exalted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
opinion of a people who could desecrate so noble
a memory by so barbarous an observance.</p>

<p>The fitting celebration of Independence Day is a
question on which patriotic Americans are separated
into two widely divergent parties, one claiming that
it ought to be observed as noisily as possible, the
other believing that our national birthday is too glorious
an occasion to be marred by din and disorder. Of
course we know that even among those who favor
a boisterous observance there are many who cannot
tolerate it themselves, and escape to the country in
order to avoid the tortures of the “awful Fourth”;
just as we know that a large proportion of the noise-makers,
including the small boy and the big boy, too,
is heedless, if not ignorant, of all that our holiday
stands for, and thinks of it only as a time when
clamor may reign unrestrained.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The figures which indicate the price that we pay
for each of our yearly celebrations are so appalling
that one would suppose a knowledge of them would
be the most powerful deterrent to our annual massacre.
This, unfortunately, is not the case. For the
past five years, the <i>Journal of the American Medical
Association</i> has endeavored to collect statistics setting
forth what the celebration of the Fourth costs
in life and human usefulness; and although these are
admittedly incomplete,—compiled, as they are, almost
entirely from newspaper reports instead of from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
records of hospitals, dispensaries, and physicians,—they
form the gravest possible arraignment of the
recklessness which is willing to pay such a price for
a “jolly day.” They show that during the celebration
of five national birthdays, from 1903 to 1907 inclusive,
eleven hundred and fifty-three persons were
killed, and twenty-one thousand five hundred and
twenty were injured! Of the injured, eighty-eight
suffered total, and three hundred and eighty-nine partial,
blindness; three hundred and eight persons lost
arms, legs, or hands, and one thousand and sixty-seven
lost one or more fingers. But these figures, startling as
they are, convey only a faint idea of the suffering,
both physical and mental, which went to swell the
total cost of these five holidays; in this we must also
include the weeks and often months of anguish of
the injured, the suspense of entire families while the
fate of some loved one hung in the balance, the horror
of a future of sightless years, the pinching poverty
now the lot of many because of the death or maiming
of the breadwinner.</p>

<p>But putting aside the question of fatalities, of invalidism,
of blindness, of penury, the effect on the
sick of a long continuance of explosive noises, varying
in intensity for days, or even weeks, and deafening
for twenty-four hours at least, merits serious consideration.
That the return of our “glorious
Fourth” is looked forward to with dread by our
hospital-sick, as well as by those who are concerned
in their care, was made pathetically clear to me last
summer when I interviewed the superintendents of
almost all our municipal institutions. One and all
deplored the needless suffering inflicted on their patients
by our barbarous manner of celebration, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
begged me to bring the matter to the attention of the
Police Department.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>In this connection, a letter from Dr. Thomas
Darlington, Commissioner of Health, is of interest:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I agree entirely with you in regard to the serious injury
inflicted upon patients in the hospitals occasioned by
the common practice of exploding firecrackers and torpedoes
in the immediate vicinity.</p>

</div>

<p>Professor William Hanna Thomson took the same
stand when he stated:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I rejoice to hear that your Society for the Suppression
of Unnecessary Noise proposes to have measures taken to
lessen the explosions of firecrackers and firearms in the
neighborhood of our city hospitals on the Fourth of July.
Such noises are particularly injurious, both from their
nature and their being of an unusual kind, to patients
with any high fever, such as typhoid, and it will be a
great service to humanity to have them suppressed, if not
altogether, as most sane people will acknowledge, yet at
least near institutions harboring a variety of patients.</p>

</div>

<p>One feature of our celebration which has not yet
been touched upon is the cost. Last year, New York<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
City boasted of an outlay of four million dollars, while
the country as a whole burned up the huge sum of
twenty million dollars in fireworks. Finally, we
must add the vast sum lost by conflagrations before
we are in a position to realize the whole price that we
pay for our day of jollity.</p>

<p>It is interesting to remark how strongly the press
is beginning to voice its protest against our “noise-fest”—a
protest now largely seconded by public
opinion, although a few years ago it would have been
regarded as woefully unpatriotic. Here are a few excerpts
gathered last July from widely scattered papers,
which are unanimous in decrying our present-day observance:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The most ridiculous and senseless celebration of any
great national event.—<i>New York Commercial.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>What the connection is between explosives and patriotism,
no one has ever undertaken to describe.—<i>Utica
Press.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The people must be educated to appreciate the folly of
dynamite as a factor in patriotism.—<i>Chicago Daily
Tribune.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Time to consider how our annual worship of the God
of Noise is to be abolished. This blatant and death-dealing
Divinity long ago usurped the shrine occupied by
Patriotism. Every year we carry and lay on his bloody
altars human sacrifices, like the tribute of maidens to the
Minotaur—only they are mostly boys. And so, year
after year, the “Glorious Fourth” becomes more and
more a dread festival of blood and fire and noise, of death
and mayhem.—<i>Minneapolis Journal.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The traditional gunpowder and dynamite orgies of Independence
Day are wrong. Firearms and explosives
have no place in any sane scheme of city life.—<i>Cleveland
Plain Dealer.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The day on which human folly too frequently runs
amuck.... That the achievement of our national
independence, brought about through the necessary spilling
of great quantities of blood, should be commemorated
by the very general loss of life and limb is as unnecessary
as it is deplorable.—<i>Union</i> (Manchester, N. H.).</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Americans are realizing that noises, maimed and

the sequence of the Nation’s birthday.—<i>Toledo Blade.</i></p>

</div>

is made a day of general carnage and a day toward
which adults look forward with dread and whose passing
they look back upon with a sense of mighty relief.—<i>Pioneer

Fourth of July and, in its place, run up the flag of peace,

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The total results of our last “jolly celebration” of
Independence Day were 164 killed and 4,249 injured,
many of them being maimed for life! Is this method of
celebration really worth while?—<i>Journal Amer. Med.
Assn.</i> (Chicago).</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>How can any satisfaction be taken in the perversion of
a holiday to purposes of disorder and destruction, and
how can any pride be felt in methods of observance which
inevitably condemn hundreds—if not thousands—to be
shot, burned, maimed, and otherwise disfigured and tortured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
in propitiation of the great god of senseless uproar?—<i>New
York Tribune.</i></p>

</div>

<p>As for those who are in favor of continuing our
present mode of celebration, I can find but one who
has written openly in its defense, and even then there
is a suspicion that the article is ironical.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is better to shock the sensitive nerves of a few grown
people than to have the boys and girls grow up molly-coddles,
with the fear of gunpowder in their hearts and
no appreciation of a boisterous holiday, rich in patriotic
appeal, and full of the “rough house” spirit of healthy
Americanism.</p>

</div>

<p>This, if seriously meant, reaches the height of
absurdity; for if there is one thing of which little children
should have a wholesome dread, it is gunpowder,
and I know of no other country in which such a
weapon is put into the hands of babes.</p>

<p>It is customary with us to excuse ourselves for
Fourth of July accidents by putting all the blame on
the small boy. This, however, seems scarcely fair.
The blame for much of the annual massacre rests not
upon the careless small boy, but upon the careless
big parent who places in his hand the instrument of
destruction. And an even greater share of the blame
is due to public apathy, which not only allows the
annual suspension of sane and safe ordinances regulating
the use of firearms and explosives, but also permits
the disorderly few to injure the health and
disturb the repose of the orderly many.</p>

<p>As proving that noise is the great desideratum in
fireworks, a few extracts from various catalogues will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
prove interesting. Here, for instance, is a piece the
figures of which, according to the thrilling description,
move about “whistling and screaming in fantastic,
wild, unearthly furore, terminating with a fusillading
report,” and another which bursts “with terrific reports
that can be heard for miles,” while a third explodes
“with reports equal to six- and twelve-pound
cannons,” and a fourth like “an imitation rapid-fire
Gatling-gun.” An appreciative testimonial lauds a
“Salute of LYDDITE SHELLS, nothing giving such
a tremendous report having ever before been heard in
our celebration,” while other goods are emphatically
praised as being “loudest and best,” or “big in
noise.” One particular piece is noticeable because it
consists of a string of fifty thousand firecrackers.
As corroborative of all this, which tends to show that
noise is what is desired above all else in fireworks,
comes this published interview with a dealer, which is
certainly illuminating:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The exploding cane is always a winner so long as it
is not suppressed by the police. Blank cartridges come
up at the head of the list. Nothing gives a celebrator so
much pleasure as flourishing a pistol and shooting several
times in rapid succession. There is just one thing that
determines the efficiency of any contrivance designed for
celebrating the Fourth, and that is, the volume of sound
it makes. For that reason the cannon firecrackers are
popular, and always will remain so.</p>

</div>

<p>This, then, is what excites the patriotic fervor of
the partisans of a strident Fourth, though it does seem
as if their enthusiasm would be somewhat lessened in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
placing side by side with the above this extract from
the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>,
which considers the causative factors of the aftermath
of last Independence Day:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Of the 102 deaths aside from tetanus, gunshot wounds
caused twenty, giant crackers caused thirteen, and thirteen
deaths were due to explosions of powder, torpedoes
and dynamite. Ten deaths were due to falls or runaways
caused by firecrackers.... The limit of tolerance
is reached, however, when we know that thirty-one persons
were burned to death.... The principal cause
of the most mutilating wounds is by far the giant cracker....
This year 1,489 injuries, including thirteen deaths
and eight cases of lockjaw, were due to the giant cracker.</p>

</div>

<p>It is a reflection scarcely calculated to gratify our
national pride that the United States is the only civilized
country which observes the greatest of its fête-days
in such an uncivilized fashion. Our sister republics,
France, Switzerland, and Brazil, rejoice full
as heartily as we over their national birthdays, but
they celebrate them in a sane, safe, wholesome, and
happy way, and not in our barbarous manner. As regards
the observance of the French fête, July 14th,
Marcel Prévost, the eminent writer, has kindly described
it for me in the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The fête of July 14th is, above all, in France, a day of
popular rejoicing; politics do not enter into it. It affords
an opportunity of illuminating the town-halls and public
buildings, and of indulging in the pleasure of dancing in
the open air. In a word, it is a huge kermess. It has
always taken place in order and tranquillity. Accidents
are rare, even in Paris. And since the review at Longchamps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
has humanely been arranged to take place at nine
in the morning, instead of at noon, the troops do not run
the risk of sunstroke, which sometimes saddened the early
fêtes of July 14th.</p>

</div>

<p>The following touchingly beautiful account of the
observance of Switzerland’s birthday was sent me by
Dr. Eugène Richard, Member of the Council of State:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Year by year the people of Switzerland keep the anniversary
of 1291, which was in real truth the foundation
of the Confederation. Does that treaty—founded by the
inhabitants of the Forest Cantons, borrowing from justice
her most equitable principles (even down to that of
arbitration between states), and guaranteed by the rigid
energy of its signers—receive a commemoration worthy
of its splendid simplicity?</p>

<p>No clamorous ceremony, to drown the voices of the
past, instead of blending with them. We give proof of
our remembrance of the First of August by a few brief
manifestations during the closing hours of the day.</p>

<p>This national solemnity, surprising as it may seem,
finds no place in the list of legal holidays. No one interrupts
his daily tasks, for such was the way with the men
of 1291, who, returning to their homes, took up again the
care of their herds.</p>

<p>As night descends, the bells on all the churches are set
to pealing in a sublime concert of gratitude, rising with
penetrating poetry through the serenity and softness of a
summer night. Shortly afterward bonfires are kindled
along the heights. Here and there will be a modest illumination
or rare display of fireworks. Occasionally an
orator reminds the people of the significance of their rejoicing
and holds up for imitation the character of our
ancestors.</p>

<p>Whoever witnesses this spectacle realizes the strength
and the sincerity of a patriotism that, without clamor or
ostentation, draws fresh life by reverting to its original<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
sources. Switzerland lives in the heart of her citizens.
A noisy demonstration would take from us the benefit of
a thoughtful mood.</p>

<p>In order to produce an impression both profound and
salutary, national celebrations must needs have a pervading
tranquillity, which enhances their dignity, and
leads mankind to earnest thought.</p>

</div>

<p>According to a very charming letter from his Excellency,
Señor Joaquin Nabuco, Brazilian Ambassador,
it appears that although his countrymen do not
observe their festivals with that calm, patriotic fervor
which characterizes the Swiss, and although they rejoice
in noise as well as in color, there is nothing to
show that their holidays are marred by that disorder
and by those horrible lists of casualties and accidents
which disgrace the celebration of our great anniversary.</p>

<p>The following delightful description of Germany’s
greatest festival, the Emperor’s birthday, has been
given me by Professor Hugo Münsterberg of Harvard
University:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When I look backward to my boyhood days in Germany
and ask myself from what sources my young patriotism
was steadily supplied, I cannot value highly
enough the influence of the patriotic celebrations in my
school and my native town. The dearest memory belongs
to the Emperor’s birthday. I know quite well that
the present Emperor was born in January; but when I
hear the word “Emperor’s birthday,” it still always
awakes in me first the date of the 22d of March—the old
Emperor’s day.</p>

<p>Long before, the school planned everything for the
grand day; patriotic and religious music, songs and patriotic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
declamations by the younger pupils, short dramatic
plays with motives from German history, given by the
older boys, and always an enthusiastic oration by one of
the teachers. In Sunday clothes we gathered in the
school; everything was decorated with flowers and garlands
and flags, and the whole school continuously, year
by year, was lifted up in a common pride and enthusiasm.
Two or three of the happiest morning hours were devoted
to the celebration, and the jubilant hurrah for the beloved
Emperor at the end of the historic oration was the only
sound of the day.</p>

<p>Then we streamed out into the decorated streets, enjoyed
the picturesque parades and went to the concert at
the market-place, where patriotic marches kindled our
youthful emotions. The afternoon belonged to parties at
home, where school friends gathered and enjoyed their
games with a historic flavor and the chocolate with a patriotic
abundance of cakes. Quiet, mellow days they were,
and any loud noise would have appeared to us boys as
a desecration of the festivity; and yet the loyalty which
I stored up in those March days of my boyhood still supplies
me amply when I have, year for year on the 27th
of January, to make my Emperor’s birthday orations to
the German-Americans.</p>

</div>

<p>An interesting account of the manner in which
Japan celebrates her fêtes was kindly written for me
by his Excellency Viscount Aoki, recently Japanese
Ambassador to the United States:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In Japan we have three great national holidays. They
are November 3d, the present Emperor’s birthday; New
Year’s Day; and February 11th, the Day of the Accession
of the Emperor Jimmu, the first ruler of the Empire of
Japan.</p>

<p>An illustration of the Emperor’s birthday celebration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
in Japan will be sufficient to give a general idea as to how
our national holidays are celebrated at home, for there
is little difference in the way of its celebration between
the above-named three holidays, except in minor details:</p>

<p>On the Emperor’s birthday all offices, schools, banks,
and large business houses are closed. The national flag
is hoisted on all public buildings, schools, and on most of
the private houses all over the country. High dignitaries,
both civil and military, who are present in the capital,
proceed to the Palace of Tokio to present before the
throne their congratulations for the occasion, while those
in the country and abroad send their congratulatory messages
by mail through the Minister for the Imperial
Household. In every school all over the country the day
is observed in a form appropriate to the occasion. One
hundred and one salutes are fired from every fort in the
empire. The imperial review of the army is in regular
order of the celebration of the day, when hundreds of
thousands of the enthusiastic public gather around the
drill-ground and all along the imperial route to cheer
their august and beloved sovereign and to witness the
glorious military parade of the day, while all of his Majesty’s
ships fire twenty-one salutes (otherwise known as
the national salute) and appear in full dress. The Emperor
entertains in the palace at breakfast all the foreign
representatives and high dignitaries of the empire.</p>

</div>

<p>And now let us listen to what some of our prominent
Americans, whose patriotism none can assail,
have to say about our present-day observance. First
“Mark Twain,” in whose heart of hearts the small
boy is enshrined, and who certainly would not needlessly
curtail even one of his little pleasures. Does he
approve of our day of “burning” patriotism? No;
for he has written to me:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I am with you sincerely in your crusade against the
bedlam frenzies of the Fourth of July.</p>

</div>

<p>And William Dean Howells:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I am glad that you have added to your noble and
beneficent ambition to suppress all unnecessary noises the
wish especially to deal with the barbarous and obstreperous
celebration of the Fourth of July. I am sure that
Confucius did not invent gunpowder, and that it was not
Chinese <i>wisdom</i> which gave us firecrackers. Until we
cease to glorify our national birthday like a nation of
lawless boys we shall have no right to claim that we have
come of age, and the civilized world must regard us as
savages until we stop behaving like them.</p>

</div>

<p>And one of our poets:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is good news that you are turning your attention to
the subject of the irrational manner in which Americans
celebrate their independence. I am sure you will not
merely advocate the suppression of meaningless noise,
and that you will indicate such fêtes, ceremonies, pageants,
and celebrations in general as are rational and instructive;
also, that you will hint at a broader and more inspiring
use of the day than either arousing old and
debasing international enmities or the display of indecent
self-glorification.</p>

<p>As to the suppression of Fourth of July noise, with its
dangers to nerve, limb, and life, the whole sensible population
will wish you a continuance of that success which
has followed your efforts on a narrower scale in the
metropolis. I am reminded that in the sweet and peaceful
valley from which I write the national holiday is
looked forward to with apprehension, on account of the
dreadful, sleep-scattering noises of the night and dawn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
before. On the Fourth, why should we not have music
instead of noise, art, instead of gunpowder? Every community
in the United States will have occasion to bless
your name and memory if you can do something substantial
toward making more quiet and more ennobling
the anniversary of the day that gave the Republic birth.</p>

</div>

<p>Here, too, is a letter from Dr. Weir Mitchell:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If anything can be done to lessen the noise of the
Fourth of July celebrations, it will also be efficient in
lessening the amount of injuries inflicted by the desire
of man and boy to make meaningless noises. Not only
does it leave the Fourth of July as an annually recurrent
unpleasant memory, but there is the same absurd tendency
to extend the nuisance of noises into other days. Thus
at present in this city, and I presume elsewhere, the first
of the year is ushered in by a vast chorus of idiotic
noises produced by steam-whistles, firecrackers, and
horns, accompanied by a solemn bell-ringing, such as in
old times called those who watched for the coming of
the New Year to prayer.</p>

</div>

<p>That our Commissioner of Health fully recognizes
the necessity of bringing about a saner mode of celebration
is shown by the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Your plan to include, as part of the activities of the
Society for the Suppression of Unnecessary Noise, the
question of a more sensible celebration of the Fourth of
July, meets with my most hearty approval. The long
list of killed and wounded, which comes as the result of
what should be a day of patriotic inspiration, is certainly
appalling, and indicative of how far we have strayed
from its true spirit.</p>

<p>Your efforts to induce the people of this country to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
celebrate its most joyous anniversary in a manner fitting
and appropriate, provide an object which should enlist
the sympathy and coöperation of all who have the welfare
of their country at heart.</p>

</div>

<p>And finally ... I offer this letter from the
Hon. Henry L. West, Commissioner of the District
of Columbia, which shows that even officialdom is
willing to risk the charge of lack of patriotism, if by
so doing our boys and girls may be saved from the
horrors of a day of catastrophes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I am thoroughly in sympathy with any movement which
will result in decreasing the habit of carelessly using gunpowder
on the Fourth of July and which will also result
in a more quiet celebration of the day.</p>

<p>In Washington the authorities have already taken a
step in the right direction in forbidding the explosion of
the so-called giant firecrackers, nor is it allowable to
place torpedoes on the street railway tracks.</p>

<p>I believe that the Fourth of July can be celebrated with
as much patriotism and more sanity if the wanton use of
gunpowder on that day is condemned.</p>

</div>

<p>And now, before taking up the question of what
might be suggested as a more reverent and appropriate
mode of honoring our day of days, let us look
back a hundred years or so, and see how our first
national birthdays were kept. Here it is encouraging
to learn that nothing resembling in the least our
wild orgy of noise was dreamed of. Indeed, had such
a suggestion been breathed to the sons and daughters
of our Revolutionary heroes, they would probably
have felt that the plan savored more of China, the
land of noise and the home of the firecracker, than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
of their own country, and have been profoundly
shocked at the mere idea that such an anniversary
could receive so murderous a recognition. A glance
over the time-yellowed pages of the <i>Evening Post</i>,
printed more than a century ago, or those of the <i>New
York Packet</i>, which was old when the <i>Post</i> was
young, shows how differently the Fourth was observed
by those who had seen burst into full flower
that glorious patriotism which had given it birth.
The proclamations, announcements, poems, and advertisements
which appeared in those July days of
long ago are touching in their patriotic, though
grandiloquent, fervor. Here, for instance, is a bit
from an announcement of the Tammany Association
which appeared in the “Season of Fruit, Year of the
Discovery, 310” (July 1):</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Brothers. This Day, like the Sun which illuminates it,
sheds a bright and diffusive luster, and welcomes all to
partake of its radiance. Once it witnessed the blood-stained
field, the plundered town, the ravaged coast, the
sinking warrior, the defenseless town, the despondency
of our Guardian Genius. But the Great Spirit watched
over the western clime, and now its approach is hailed
with the incense of Peace; and the veteran rejoices in
his scars, the hoary chief and his patriot sons assemble
with congratulations where once the noise of battle was
heard, and the Eagle towers aloft majestic and unawed.</p>

</div>

<p>In these days the celebration began with unfurling
the flag, a salute of thirteen guns and ringing of
church-bells, followed by a procession and exchange of
courtesies between the Governor and the President.
Then came the march to church, where odes, addresses,
anthems, and orations were in order with, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
course, the reading of the Declaration of Independence.
Next, luncheon, with more salutes and bell-ringing
and then, evening having come, performances
in theaters and gardens and the meeting of various
patriotic societies. Everything connected with the performances
was patriotically reminiscent. In the gardens,
transparencies and fireworks portrayed temples
of immortality, obelisks of heroes, and figures of Justice,
Fidelity, Fame, and Piety, all radiantly intermingled
with shining pictures of Washington and of
the Arms of the United States, with its brilliant stars,
while at the theater, patriotic plays were given, such as
“Bunker Hill” or the “Death of Warren and the
Glory of Columbia” or the “Retrospect of the American
Revolution.” This all refers to New York, but it
is probable that virtually the same observance obtained
in other large cities.</p>

<p>Let us now consider what might be substituted for
our present-day mad and dangerous celebration, which
serves only to keep in remembrance one feature of our
great struggle, the cannonading and musketry-discharges
which shook the country during the arduous
days of its birth. I sincerely believe that our national
birthday can be observed with heartfelt patriotic rejoicing,
and yet without the slightest danger to life or
limb, without any nerve-racking noise or display of
hoodlumism, and without any of the extravagant outlay
which has characterized our former celebrations.
Flags can float, national music be played and sung in
places now given over solely to the deafening din of
cannon firecrackers, the Declaration of Independence
be read at all of our public buildings, where inspiring
addresses may also be made, and street-displays, such
as processions with floats, beautiful as well as instructive,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
furnish delightful object-lessons of the greatest
events in our history. Then, at night, we may have
illuminations, both private and municipal, and displays
of fireworks in open places, where the exhibitions can
be conducted by experienced men, thus avoiding all
danger of the shocking accidents which now sadden
our celebration. Let us, on this day, forget the noise
of battle and the passions of international strife, and
remember only the wonderful spirit of sacrifice, and
patriotism, and brotherhood which animated our Revolutionary
heroes. Let us, who know what the day
means, endeavor to make it both memorable and illuminating
to those who do not, by opening the hearts of
the children, of the poor and ignorant, of the distressed
and disheartened alien within our gates, to at least a
partial significance of what we honor in our glorious
festival. Let us enter personally into the work, giving
tender endeavor as well as means to the task of making
the occasion the happiest of all the year to the
ignorant and the wretched. Let us give them a day
of liberty in the country or in the parks, where they
will see our beautiful flag floating everywhere about
them, and where their untrained ears will become accustomed
to the ringing rhythm of our national melodies.
Let us give them mementos of the Fourth, such
as flags and pictures of our heroes and of those whom
we love as well as honor. There let them listen to
the story of the birth of our Republic, and have it told
simply and, if necessary, in their own tongues, so that
all can feel how great were those who made the country
free, and how wonderful is the boon of liberty now
extended to the oppressed of other countries.</p>

<h3>A SAFE AND SANE FOURTH OF JULY</h3>

<p class="author">BY HENRY LITCHFIELD WEST</p>

<p class="center smaller">(From <i>The Forum</i>, August, 1909.)</p>

<p>A little more than a year ago the <i>Century Magazine</i>
contained a vigorous and convincing article by
Mrs. Isaac L. Rice, entitled “Our Barbarous Fourth.”
It was a protest against a condition of affairs in the
United States which had long attracted attention but
which no one, up to that time, had criticised in such
emphatic terms. “The grim statistics of the Fourth of
July,” said the article, “probably furnish a sadder
commentary of human folly than that afforded by any
other celebration in the world.”...</p>

<p>It is true that a few thoughtful people had in more
or less nonchalant manner observed the terrible toll
of death and injury which the evil celebration of
the day demanded. Quite a number of newspapers—notably
the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>—were questioning the
wisdom of a method which in one day had resulted in
the death of 164 people, and the injury of nearly
5,000. “How can any satisfaction,” asked the <i>New
York Tribune</i>, “be taken in the perversion of a holiday
to purposes of disorder and destruction, and how
can any pride be felt in methods of observance which
inevitably condemn hundreds—if not thousands—to
be shot, burned, maimed, and otherwise disfigured and
tortured in propitiation of the great god of senseless
uproar?” The <i>St. Paul Pioneer Press</i> deplored the
fact that a day which ought to be the most enjoyable
in the calendar had become a day of general carnage;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
while the <i>New York Commercial</i> characterized the
popular celebration as ridiculous and senseless.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these occasional utterances of
truth, which indicated a growing sentiment, the fact is,
that at the time of the appearance of “Our Barbarous
Fourth” there was only one city in the country
wherein any curb had been placed upon the insensate
and reckless custom of observing the Fourth of July
with dynamite and gunpowder. The cemeteries and
the hospitals were claiming their victims and yet no
one in authority seemed courageous enough to call a
halt for fear of being charged with lack of patriotism.
I believe, however, that the article in question appeared
at the psychological moment. It was so
straightforward in its presentation of the facts, so
earnest in its appeal and so logical in its assertion that
there were numerous sensible ways of celebrating our
national holiday, that it made a profound impression
everywhere. At any rate, the fact is, that before that
article appeared only one city in the country had prohibited
the sale and explosion of fireworks, while
within a short period after it had been printed the
authorities in several cities took radical action along
the lines therein suggested. It is no exaggeration to
say that within the next ten years the old barbarous
Fourth of July will have entirely disappeared, and it
is also within the bounds of accurate statement to add
that the one greatest individual factor in accomplishing
the much-needed reform is the author of the <i>Century</i>
article.</p>

<p>All this is by way of preface to the fact that the experiment
of a safe and sane Fourth of July was tried
this year in the National Capital; and in the belief that
its details will prove of general interest, they are herewith<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
recorded. If, as now seems to be the case, we
are on the verge of a revolution in the customs which
have been in vogue for half a century, the methods by
which the change is to be accomplished are not without
their value and significance.</p>

<p>The celebration of the national holiday in the capital
a year ago had been marked by so many accidents and
fires that some protest against the indiscriminate use of
fireworks was uttered, and the Commissioners who
govern the city declared themselves in published interviews
in favor of a safer and saner observance of the
day. No definite action was taken, however, until
last November, when the question became acute because
hundreds of dealers in fireworks in the city were
naturally anxious to know whether they would be permitted
to handle explosives. Inquiry of other cities
brought forth the fact that Cleveland had already
enacted an ordinance forbidding the sale and discharge
of fireworks, and a copy of this ordinance was secured.
In Washington, as ought to be generally known, there
is no common council or board of aldermen, but all
regulations governing the municipality are promulgated
by the three Commissioners under authority
delegated to them by Congress. The question whether
Washington should undertake the experiment of a
non-explosive Fourth rested, therefore, with these
three men, and it did not take them long to reach their
conclusion. One of them had, more than a year previously,
formally expressed his sympathy with the object
sought to be attained by the opponents of the
barbarous Fourth, and his colleagues were, happily, of
the same opinion. In November, therefore, eight
months before the arrival of the holiday, the following
regulation was enacted:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No firecracker, squib, or other fireworks of any kind
shall be sold and delivered, discharged or set off within
the city of Washington, or the fire limits of the District of
Columbia, or in the more densely populated portions of
said District; provided, however, on occasions of public
celebration and exhibition fireworks may be discharged or
set off on special permits issued by the Commissioners
defining the time, place, storage and such other conditions
to be observed in reference thereto as they may deem
necessary to the public safety. No gun, air gun, rifle, air
rifle, pistol, revolver, or other firearm, cannon or torpedo
shall be discharged or set off within the city of Washington,
or the fire limits of the District of Columbia, without
a special written permit therefor from the Major and
Superintendent of Police, nor within five hundred yards
of the Potomac River, Eastern Branch, or Anacostia
River, Rock Creek, or any public road, highway, school-house,
building or buildings, shed, barn, outhouse, public
park, reservation, graveyard or burial place, playground,
golf course, tennis court, picnic ground, camp ground,
or any place where people are accustomed to congregate,
inclosure for stock, railroad track, outside of such fire
limits for the District of Columbia, without the written
consent of the owner or occupant thereof and a special
written permit from the Major and Superintendent of
Police.”</p>

</div>

<p>No law or regulation can, however, be effective unless
it is sustained by public sentiment. The Commissioners
were fortunate in securing the voluntary and
enthusiastic support of the members of the Board of
Trade and the Chamber of Commerce, the representative
local organizations, and, in general, the citizenship
of the capital was favorably disposed to the new order
of things. Committees were formed for the purpose of
providing two patriotic public entertainments, one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
in the morning to consist of the reading of the Declaration
of Independence and appropriate addresses, and
the other to include a fine display of fireworks at night
upon the ellipse south of the White House. The
funds for the latter were promptly supplied by public
subscription, and the affair was managed most successfully
by a volunteer committee, no less than forty
thousand people witnessing the display. In the meantime,
the residents of various sections of the District
undertook to uphold sympathetically the Commissioners
by devising their own collective celebrations. In
Cleveland Park, an attractive suburban district, there
was a public meeting with a programme of fireworks
handled by experts, while Bloomingdale, another well-settled
section, enjoyed a day of athletic sports,
speeches and aerial fireworks. In short, the people of
the District of Columbia cheerfully accepted the proclamation,
which was issued by the Commissioners, inviting
attention to the police regulations which had
been adopted “to provide against the dangers incident
to the manner of observing the Fourth of July and
Christmas, which previously prevailed,” and appealing
“to the people of the District of Columbia heartily to
second their efforts by observing and counseling the
observance of these regulations.”</p>

<p>Nor were the entertainments already mentioned the
only forms of celebration. The <i>Washington Post</i> conceived
the idea of an automobile floral-flag parade, and
this event proved to be a genuine spectacular and
artistic success. There were over a hundred motor
cars in line, and the decorations were extremely novel
and pleasing. One automobile was reconstructed into
an accurate representation of the Confederate ram
<i>Merrimac</i>, and was manned by young men in sailor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
costumes; another was converted into a yacht with
masts and sails; another was a floral boat apparently
drawn by an enormous white swan; and still another
was in the form of a pergola, decorated with wistaria
vines and blossoms. An electric machine which
elicited the applause of the thousands who lined the
route of parade was apparently a huge wicker basket
of pink roses, in the center of which and surmounted
by a canopy of roses was seated the lady who operated
the car. Another electric machine was a symphony
in red, white and blue. Altogether, the event proved
to be a most unique and beautiful celebration, and the
committee of artists who awarded the cups and other
prizes, valued at $1,500, was confronted by a most
difficult task of selection. When it is considered that
the affair was the first of its kind in the National
Capital, and was merely suggested as one form of
rational enjoyment, its successful execution occasioned
deserved felicitation, and when it is repeated next year,
as it will be, the national holiday will be made literally
a day of delight.</p>

<p>The real value, however, of the experiment in the
National Capital still remains to be recorded. Instead
of a long list of dead and injured, there was not a
single gunpowder accident in the city, and the two
minor alarms of fire were not occasioned by explosives.
The contrast between the recent Fourth of July celebration
and those of previous years, is strikingly shown
in the following figures:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>Before the Fourth there was some division of opinion
as to the outcome; after the Fourth the public
sentiment was practically unanimous as to the humanity
and wisdom of a safe and sane celebration. This
sentiment found editorial expression in the daily newspapers,
and those communities which are considering
the advisability of abolishing the dangerous customs
of the past, might with great profit read these comments.
They are here incorporated almost in their
entirety:</p>

<p><i>Washington Herald</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Having celebrated the Fourth of July in a safe and
sane manner, it is reasonably sure that Washington will
not hereafter entertain the thought of going back to the
stereotyped, unsafe, and insane way of observing the anniversary
of the country’s independence. It is true that
the day, for the most part, was so quiet as to be almost
Sabbathlike; but, thanks to an ideally delightful spell of
weather, every hour, from dawn until the night festivities
concluded, was full of wholesome enjoyment. A welcome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
relief it was, indeed, to be spared the affliction of the ear-splitting
firecracker and toy cannon nuisance and kindred
evils that made other Fourths so hideous. And a more
welcome relief still is the knowledge to-day that Washington,
at least, has not a long hospital list of maimed and
suffering victims of the reckless use of explosives.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Washington Times</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>On the day following the Fourth, it will be difficult to
find many people who will not give their approval to the
innovation. Nobody’s home was burned up, nobody succeeded
in killing himself or his neighbor; there are no
incipient cases of lockjaw under observation. The tendency
to those other forms of disorder which grow out of
indulgence in the cup that cheers—and perhaps deafens—was
less marked than ever before. The police and the
hospitals alike had an easy time of it. Not a single accident
worthy the name, of the distinctive variety which
has made Independence Day an occasion of carnage and
terror, took place in Washington. That is a remarkable
record.</p>

<p>Safety and sanity, in short, vindicated themselves to
perfection. Promiscuous noise was simply impossible
because of the strict prohibition of the sale and use of
fireworks and other abominations in the racket-making
line. Altogether, it was a glorious day, and it is sincerely
to be hoped that it will come in similar fashion once per
annum, and in time lead people to a cheerful ability honestly
to rejoice that their country did attain its freedom.</p>

<p>Papers in unsafe and insane communities please copy.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Washington Star</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>After yesterday’s experience it is doubtful whether
Washington will ever return to the old customs of Independence
Day celebrations. The “safe and sane” Fourth
idea was carried out in a manner to please practically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
the entire community, to give some form of entertainment
to the greatest possible number throughout the day, without
contributing a single accident of any kind to the records.</p>

<p>Taken in detail, yesterday’s celebration features were
calculated to please all classes. For those who wished to
dwell seriously upon the patriotic aspect of the occasion
there was the open-air meeting, where exercises appropriate
to the day were held. For the children there was
no lack of amusement, with the daylight fireworks diverting
them on three different occasions. The floral automobile
parade was a novelty that drew large numbers to
the line, while the day was appropriately closed with an
exceptional exhibition of fireworks, concluding with the
illumination of Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>

<p>An ideal day in overhead conditions, yesterday afforded
the best opportunity to try the new idea of Independence
Day celebration. In consequence of all the arrangements
and restrictions there was a remarkable lack of noise
from morning till night. There were no fires and the hospital
ambulance was less busy even than on ordinary
occasions. The policemen had an easy time, being occupied
chiefly in preserving lines at the various points of
congregation. There was a noteworthy lack of public
intoxication. In short, Washington demonstrated that it
can enjoy itself in a dignified, decent manner.</p>

<p>With the experience of yesterday in mind, the authorities
and citizens who engage in such enterprises can proceed
next year to organize an Independence Day celebration
that will be even better. It has been proved that it
is possible to stop the promiscuous discharge of firecrackers
and other forms of explosives. This is in itself an
immense advantage. There is no reason to doubt the
ability of the Commissioners to maintain order in the
same manner next year. It may be suggested that the
1910 programme should include more public music of a
patriotic character at intervals during the day and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
the chief feature of the occasion be some form of historic
pageant.</p>

</div>

<p>In the face of this splendid and sensible record, it is
appalling to read the reports from other cities. The
death of Arthur Granville Langham, uncle of the
Baroness von Sternberg, which occurred in Louisville,
as the result of the explosion of a cannon cracker, was
especially tragic, but the occurrences in other municipalities
are none the less sad because the victims were
not as prominent in social and financial circles. Here
are some of the figures:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">New York.</span> Five killed, 197 injured by fireworks, 82
injured by pistols, 23 injured by cannons and 3 injured
by torpedoes; also, 116 fires started by explosives. Notwithstanding
this list of victims, one of the most prominent
New York papers remarked that New York had
broken all records for a safe and sane Fourth of July.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philadelphia.</span> Five dead, 3 fatally injured, 8 seriously
injured and 420 painfully injured; 80 fires.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Louis.</span> Four dead, 205 injured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wilkesbarre, Pa.</span> Four dead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pittsburg.</span> One dead, 295 injured; fire loss, $50,000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Memphis, Tenn.</span> A crippled newsboy burned to death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheeling, W. Va.</span> One dead, 50 injured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffalo.</span> Fifteen children injured, 40 fires.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boston.</span> One hundred and ten persons injured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toledo.</span> Boy’s left hand necessarily amputated and a
fifteen-year-old boy blinded for life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kansas City.</span> One death from lockjaw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elmira, N. Y.</span> Two deaths from lockjaw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woonsocket, R. I.</span> One dead and a dozen persons injured.</p>

</div>

<p>Other cities, without regard to section, afford a painful
repetition of casualty. It seems strange that this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
annual holocaust should be tolerated. There is not a
civilized country in the world which pays such a fearful
debt to alleged patriotism as the United States.
There is no question as to the devotion of the Japanese
to their country, and yet their three national holidays
are not marred by sad fatalities. Germany celebrates
the Emperor’s birthday with the greatest enthusiasm,
but without wholesale death and injury. France is
patriotic, and yet France observes its festal days in a
safe and sane fashion. In the City of Mexico, as the
writer knows by personal experience, the celebration
of Independence Day is a great popular success, and
yet not one firecracker is exploded. The experiment
in Washington demonstrates that dynamite and gunpowder
are not essential to a thorough and patriotic
enjoyment of the day. Surely the time will come
when other cities will appreciate the importance of
celebrating in some manner which will appropriately
mark the day, and yet not leave a sanguinary trail of
dead and wounded.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the safe and sane method
will not be departed from in the National Capital. In
that city, at least, there will be an example of common
sense which other municipalities might well emulate.
There will be ample opportunity for the expression of
patriotic sentiment, unaccompanied by death and disaster,
and in less than a decade the people will look
back to the ancient and barbarous customs, and wonder
how they were ever tolerated for a single hour.
Next year new methods of entertainment will be devised,
and more consideration will be given to the
children. This year the pupils of the public schools
sang patriotic songs at the various gatherings, and the
children enjoyed the automobile parade and the fireworks.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
The Fourth of July, however, is essentially
Young America’s day, and in any programme arranged
by a municipality especial consideration should
be given to the little ones. With this detail not overlooked,
there will be no question of the real success
of any Fourth of July celebration. Certainly the experiment
which the National Capital has successfully
inaugurated has proven worth while; and if the example
is generally followed by other cities, there will
be safety and sanity everywhere, nor need the splendid
fervency of our full-blooded patriotism suffer loss.</p>

<h3>THE NEW INDEPENDENCE DAY</h3>

<p class="author">BY HENRY B. F. MACFARLAND AND RICHARD B. WATROUS</p>

<p class="center smaller">(As Observed at Washington, D. C., 1909.)</p>

<p>The programme for the day provided for a display
of daylight fireworks at 7th and Pennsylvania Avenue,
a central point with park surroundings and no nearby
residences, from 9:30 until 10:30 in the morning;
then the public meeting at the same place, surrounding
the new memorial of the Grand Army of the
Republic and its founder, Dr. Stephenson, where
Senator Owen, of Oklahoma, made an oration, the
Declaration of Independence was read, the “Star
Spangled Banner” and “My Country, ’Tis of Thee”
were sung, and the school children sang other patriotic
songs, and the United States Marine Band volunteered
and gave music. After this there was another display
of daylight fireworks. At least 5,000 people,
chiefly in family groups, attended the meeting and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
saw these fireworks exhibitions, and the children were
delighted with the shows new to Washington. At
half past two in the afternoon on the great ellipse
south of the White House, at least 10,000 men, women
and children listened to a band concert and watched
another hour’s exhibition of the daylight fireworks,
the grown-ups enjoying, as much as the children, the
flags, balloons, paper animals, birds and fishes, liberated
by the bombs high in air. Later in the afternoon
a fine parade of automobiles decorated with
flags and flowers, and arranged by the <i>Washington
Post</i>, and for which it gave most of the prizes,
passed up and down Pennsylvania Avenue, crowded by
spectators, and around the Capitol and White House
and down to Potomac Park where the judges awarded
the prizes. In the evening there was an elaborate
display of fireworks on the ellipse south of the White
House, followed by a beautiful illumination of Pennsylvania
Avenue. The newspapers estimated that between
40,000 and 50,000 people saw these night exhibitions.
Never was there a more cheerful or good-tempered
crowd. Apparently the young and old
thoroughly enjoyed the whole day which had a picnic
character for most of them. Several of the suburban
communities organized their own fireworks exhibitions
and some had public meetings as well.</p>

<p>The experience of the day suggested additions and
improvements for the celebration of the next Independence
Day. Historical pageants, a regatta, more
field sports, more band concerts, and a wider distribution
of the celebration points are among the
things suggested for next year. The Joint Committee
on Arrangements has already taken steps to provide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
a permanent organization to prepare for future
celebrations, the Commissioners having announced at
once that there will be no repeal or amendment of
the regulation prohibiting the old barbaric methods
of celebrating the day. The new order of things met
the approval of President Taft who, upon being told
by the Chairman of the Joint Committee, the plans
for the celebration, wrote the following letter, which
was read at the public meeting:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">The White House, Washington</span>, July 3, 1909.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>My Dear Mr. Macfarland</i>:</p>

<p>I have your letter of July 1st with respect to the celebration
of the Fourth of July. I am very sorry that I
shall not be in the city on that day because of a previous
engagement; but I am heartily in sympathy with the
movement to rid the celebration of our country’s natal
day of those distressing accidents that might be avoided
and are merely due to a recklessness against which the
public protest cannot be too emphatic.</p>

<p class="center">Very sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) <span class="smcap">Wm. H. Taft</span>.</p>

<p class="hanging">Hon. Henry B. F. Macfarland,<br>
Commissioner of the District of Columbia.</p>

</div>

<p>This letter, sent out by the Press Association with
a brief account of the celebration, must have helped
the cause of the “safe and sane” celebration of Independence
Day everywhere.</p>

<h3>NEW FOURTHS FOR OLD</h3>

<p class="author">BY MRS. ISAAC L. RICE</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When you are past shrieking, having no human articulate
voice to say you are glad with, you fill the quietude ...
with gunpowder blasts, and rush home, red with cutaneous
eruption of conceit and voluble with convulsive hiccough of
self-satisfaction.... It is pitiful to have dim conceptions
of duty; more pitiful, it seems to me, to have conceptions
like these of mirth.”—<i>John Ruskin.</i></p>

</div>

<p>When the preparations for the celebration of a great
anniversary are identical with those for a battle, it
is time to pause and reflect whether a better observance
of the day might not be advisable—to ask ourselves
whether one might not be planned which would honor
and not dishonor a glorious memory.</p>

<p>When Physicians, Boards of Health and Hospital
Superintendents annually prepare for the reception
and treatment of hundreds, or rather thousands, who
will—before the close of the day—be brought in
torn, burned, blinded; when undertakers prepare for
the hideous aftermath of our National Birthday;
when hundreds of thousands of the sick look forward
with dread to the recurrence of this season of noise,
which to them brings so much distress; when fathers
and mothers all over the country shudder at the
thought of what the Fourth may bring to their dear
ones, I believe that one is justified in characterizing
as a national disgrace that pseudo-patriotism which is
responsible for so much agony.</p>

<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the stigma of shame
incurred by the intelligent, adult proportion of the
population in deliberately and scientifically preparing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
for the massacre and maiming of the youthful,
ignorant and heedless members of the community.
One city, for instance, added twenty-six surgeons to
its ambulance corps, while another engaged twelve distributors
of tetanus antitoxin, had field dressing
stations prepared by its National Volunteer Emergency
Service and sent around fifteen hundred vials of antitoxin
serum to its hospitals. And thus many cities
anticipated the return of their Day of Carnage, preparing
to bind wounds and lacking the courage required
to insist on the passage of drastic prohibitive
ordinances which would have rendered impossible the
shedding of blood.</p>

<p>I am sure that the thanks of all are due to one of
our medical publications which, for years past, has
compiled statistics upon statistics, based upon the price
that we pay for our present-day mad celebration of
the Fourth, for without the splendid work of the
<i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> we
should be unable to estimate the cost of our annual
holiday. As for the figures, so laboriously compiled,
they are simply amazing. To think of fifteen hundred
and thirty-one deaths and thirty-three thousand and
seventy-three accidents, the fearful sacrifice voluntarily
offered by us, within the last seven years, to our false
ideals! And yet these tables, shocking as they are,
give so inadequate an idea of the suffering involved!
For of these fifteen hundred and thirty-one deaths,
practically none came painlessly, almost all being accompanied
by the convulsions of tetanus, the torments
of fire, or the shock of injuries which changed healthy,
happy children into shapeless, agonizing horrors.
While as for the thirty-three thousand and seventy-three
who were injured, but not fatally, how many are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
dragging out their wretched lives, blind, maimed or
crippled!</p>

<p>What, perhaps, is the saddest feature, is the fact
that almost all the victims of the Fourth are children,
whose youth and ignorance and inexperience and helplessness
would certainly seem to merit all due protection
at our hands. Poor little ones, who play delightedly
with danger! And then how many among
the victims of the Fourth are those who have not
been “celebrating,” but who have been shot down
or burnt to death by the wanton recklessness of Independence
Day “Patriots” (God save the mark!).
Bullets, cannon-crackers, blank cartridges, and strings
of Chinese crackers spare none. Little babes have
had their heads torn open, mothers have been killed
as they sat beside their children, scores of girls have
been burnt to death by having lighted firecrackers
or fireworks thrown in their direction. Runaways
have been frequent because hoodlums love to throw
great “bombs” under frightened teams, and one of
the merriest sports has been to place large torpedoes
on car-tracks. In Vincennes (Indiana), for instance,
one Fourth was “celebrated” by placing boxes of explosives
on the tracks, by means of which car windows
were shattered, passengers terrified and injured,
and traffic blocked for hours; after these boxes had
all been picked up it was found that two barrels of
explosives had been collected. In Boston, only two
years ago, seventy arrests were made for using firearms,
while in Pittsburg a party of rich, young hoodlums
terrorized the holiday crowds by dashing along
in an automobile, firing volleys of shots up and down
the streets and into the shops. Pittsburg’s arrests July
4, 1907, numbered 300. But, then, what can we expect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
when we repeal for a period of twenty-four hours
almost all laws regarding safety and sanity?</p>

<p>As for the licensed recklessness, responsible for so
many accidents, the recital of some of the mad acts to
which it has led in the past is simply incredible. Some
of these acts were: the throwing of dynamite bombs
and giant crackers and the firing of revolvers into holiday
crowds, the tossing of lighted firecrackers into the
laps, or against the thin clothing, of women and girls,
resulting in their being roasted to death; the filling of
pipes and tin cans with dynamite, or the stuffing of bottles
with lighted firecrackers—all with inevitable consequences.
These are but a few of the acts which
caused these 33,073 accidents, but the excuse for all
was always the same—Patriotism! If this, however,
is Patriotism, then it recalls—with but a slight
variation as to meaning—that utterance of Dr. Johnson’s:
“Patriotism which is the last refuge of the
scoundrel.” However, it is not Patriotism, but only
craving for noise and excitement and danger which
kills and blinds and maims on our Day of Carnage.
Some, indeed, go so far as to declare that the usual
celebration of the Fourth is “due to desire to break
loose into a day of savagery and wallow in the unusual.”
Perhaps, if a stop is not soon put to this mad
orgy, we shall find ourselves changing the words of
our National Anthem, as suggested by one of our
dailies, and singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My country, ’Tis of Thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Thou hast Crippled Me.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>However, it is not Patriotism but Hoodlumism and
the desire to revel in a day from which all sane and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
safe restrictions have been removed, which may be
said to guide most of the celebrants on the Fourth,
for most of them are undoubtedly ignorant of its
glorious significance. That this is true was amusingly
shown in one of our large eastern cities where between
thirty and forty thousand children were asked
in the public schools why they celebrated the Fourth
of July. The favorite answer was said to have been
“For shoots,” others were: “For a band,” “For
chicken to eat,” and most astounding of all “For the
King of the Jews” (the similarity of sound between
Jew and July doubtless suggesting the last).</p>

<p>The duration of our “noise-fest” varies in different
localities, in some being limited to a few hours, in
others being permitted to extend over several weeks.
Where this premature celebration is allowed, it naturally
entails great suffering on the sick, not to speak of
the additional danger incurred by the youthful participants.
It is this early start which, doubtless,
prompted the remark: “The Fourth of July is the
only holiday which begins before it happens.” As for
the celebration proper, it generally starts on the
evening of the third and lasts until the morning or
the afternoon of the fifth. In some cities, however,
it does not begin until midnight, in others not until
four o’clock in the morning. However, even where
the noisy period is the shortest, the suffering borne
by our hospital patients is sufficient to excite the sympathy
of all those with whom they come in contact.</p>

<p>Regarding the monetary cost of our celebration,
New York City is reported to have spent about $14,000,000
on the celebration of two holidays, with a
resultant loss of 11 persons killed and 768 injured.
As for the total monetary loss to the whole country,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
it can scarcely be calculated, nor can the fire-loss be
estimated. Regarding the latter, however, I have been
enabled, through the courtesy of Mr. Miller, General
Agent of the National Board of Fire Underwriters,
to obtain a few figures which show that during five
years (from 1898 to 1902 inclusive) there were
4,827 fires in the United States due to fireworks; in
Massachusetts from 1902 to 1906 inclusive there were
278 fires due to the same cause; and in Boston in
one year, 1906, 72 took place. But quite apart from
the effect of these conflagrations on our fire-loss
(which is about nine times as high as that of the chief
countries of Europe—$3 per capita as against 33
cents), many accidents might perhaps be traced to
carelessness engendered in the young by the annually
repeated spectacle of a whole community playing with
fire and explosives. I firmly believe that this one
day of dangerous license exerts a pernicious effect
upon the other three hundred and sixty-four days of
the year.</p>

<p>An example of what an enthusiastically patriotic and
yet sane and safe holiday observance can be, was
given last May, when England and her colonies celebrated
“Empire Day.” This fête was observed by
tens of millions, scattered over one-fourth of the
world’s surface, and yet not one death was reported—not
a single accident marred the glory and the
happiness of the day. In this splendid world-pageant,
the citizens of to-morrow were the chief actors, and
it is estimated that fully eight millions took part. Children
in long procession, thousands of them in uniform,
wearing flags on their breasts and carrying them aloft
in an endless blaze of color, marched along to render
homage to the Union Jack, which fluttered out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
above their heads as the little soldiers were reviewed,
or as they sang the National Anthem. The floral
emblem of the day was the daisy or, failing that, the
bachelor’s button, marigold or marguerite—the
watchwords were “Responsibility, duty, sympathy,
self-sacrifice.” In addition to the National Anthem,
Rudyard Kipling’s “Children’s Song” was also sung
by millions of little ones:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lord of our birth, our faith, our pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For whose dear sake our Fathers died,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O, Motherland, we pledge to thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Head, heart and hand through years to be.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As for France, everybody knows how joyfully it
enters upon the celebration of its Day of Liberation,
July 14th. Military reviews, artistically beautiful
street decoration, free theatrical and operatic performances,
music, splendid displays of fireworks from
the bridges, and public dancing in the streets and
squares, make up a day of happy and sane observance—a
huge kermess. Perhaps no other country celebrates
its birthday with quite the same stern simplicity,
the same touching faith as Switzerland, when on
August 1st, no outward manifestation of the national
thanksgiving is remarked, except in the ringing of
bells and the blazing of bonfires on the mountain
peaks, or in the singing of a few inspiring songs. The
whole nation seems to be listening to the voices of
the past, while continuing its daily tasks, this sturdy
band of mountaineers! And thus with the celebrations
of yet more European countries, Germany,
Sweden, Denmark and still others, everything is
marked by sanity and order, and yet by true thanksgiving
and joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p>But although the American abroad may well blush
with shame in comparing our “Horrible Fourth,” our
“Tetanus Day,” our “Annual Massacre,” our
“Modern Massacre of Innocents,” our “Carnival of
Lockjaw,” our “Bloody Fourth,” or our “Day of
Carnage,” with the fête days of other lands, let him
take courage, for at last it really seems as if “Explosive
Patriotism” were “on the run.” Throughout
the Union, scores of cities have already passed or
are considering the passage of restrictive or, better
still, of prohibitive ordinances, and countless organizations
are getting into line in their efforts to substitute
attractive features, such as children’s processions
and merry-making, pageantry, musical festivals, picnics,
and other safe observances for our present orgy
of death. In order to show at a glance what has
already been gained by legislation in preventing
Fourth of July accidents, let us place side by side
the results obtained a few months ago in two groups
of cities. In the first let us put Washington, Cleveland,
Baltimore and Toledo, which cities protected by
prohibitive or restrictive ordinances, gave last Fourth
of July a total of twelve accidents. The other four,
New York, Philadelphia, Boston and St. Louis, which
were all relatively unprotected, gave a total of thirteen
hundred and ninety-seven accidents, or an average of
almost three hundred and fifty apiece. Drastic ordinances
and stern enforcement are required if we are
ever to down our National Disgrace.</p>

<p>Let us protect our little ones from death and danger,
and then the next step will be to learn to express
“social ideals in action,” for as Mr. Luther Gulick
so well says: “If there is any one thing, any one
occasion, in connection with which there should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
national community expression, it should be in connection
with our celebration of American independence.
This constitutes not only the pivotal point in
the history of American institutions, but is the pivotal
idea upon which democracy rests.”</p>

<p>Nothing is more inspiring than love of country,
therefore let us advocate a “religion of patriotism”
and do away with a false death-dealing patriotism
which, annually, on our National Birthday disgraces
us in the eyes of the whole civilized world.</p>

<h3>AMERICANIZING THE FOURTH</h3>

<p class="center smaller">(A Suggestion for a Pageant of Liberty.)</p>

<p class="author">BY ROBERT HAVEN SCHAUFFLER</p>

<p>The old, undemocratic idea of honoring the birthday
of American independence is embodied in annual
explosions of barbarism which have already done to
death many more persons than the Revolutionary
War destroyed. Indeed, our peaceful celebration
seems as much more dangerous than the old style
of warfare as small-pox is more dangerous than
chicken-pox.</p>

<p>Our new festival in honor of Liberty is—or is
soon to be—very different. Instead of a day of
pseudo-patriotism,—a Moloch-day sacred to blinding
and maiming our little ones, to shredding and roasting
them alive, blowing them to bits or allowing them
to struggle to their death in the horrible clutch of
tetanus—there is proposed a day of the deepest,
fairest, most enthusiastic, most genuine patriotism; a
day of emphasis not upon erratic individualism but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
upon national solidarity; a day of fun yet of education
and inspiration to old as well as young and to
all the nations that are now being fused in our gigantic
melting pot. In a word, the new movement aims, as
it should, to make the Fourth our most profoundly
<i>American</i> holiday.</p>

<p>The recent rise of the Independence Day pageant is
a by-product of two wide twentieth century movements:
the new classicism and the new democracy.
The new classicism is behind the current tendency of
certain of the arts to react from the rich, vague
elaboration of an exaggerated romanticism toward
plain, clearly organized simplicity. In a word, it is
trying to restore a normal balance between the emotional
and the intellectual elements in art. In music
this movement is led by Max Reger, the modern
Bach; in architecture it is felt in the <i>Art Nouveau</i>
and, in America, in such significant buildings as the
New York Library and the Pennsylvania Terminal; in
literature in the recent rebirth of the drama, of which
the pageant is a near relative. For the pageant has
been defined as “a dramatic presentation of the history
of a community or of the development of a phase
of civilization, given by the people themselves.”</p>

<p>The movement called the new democracy is slightly
older. Under President Roosevelt this country discovered
a new and more vital meaning in the old
term “democracy.” And it has not taken us long to
find out that on Independence Day the square deal
is less thrillingly symbolized by the maiming and
slaughter of innocent thousands through the meaningless
cracker and pistol than by the coöperation of all
nationalities and social grades on our shores in great,
concerted movements, large with the meaning of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
past, the present and the future America, and glowing
with the local colors of the many peoples that have
made and are to make this nation.</p>

<p>The inevitable medium for such expression is the
pageant. And though this form of celebration is still
in its early infancy and has not yet attained even the
modest measure of clarity already reached in other
arts by the new classicism, nor even the puny measure
of real democracy exhibited to-day by our “square
deal” renaissance, yet it is quite as big with promise
as they.</p>

<p>The Pageant of Liberty, which is here proposed, is
based on the idea that America was the pioneer in
that modern struggle for liberty which has played such
a striking part in the world’s history since 1776. Our
War of Independence inspired the French Revolution
which, in turn, brandished the torch of liberty through
Europe during the nineteenth century until, in our
day, the flame has spread to other continents.</p>

<p>This Pageant consists of a parade of simple floats
which may or may not end in a dramatic and choral
performance or “masque” in some athletic field or
fair ground or stadium. The floats and their costumed
characters are to be the actors in this masque.</p>

<p>These floats need not be elaborate or expensive or
hard to construct. In most cases all that is required
is a plain large truck, festooned with simple garlands,
and with the wheels hidden in oak branches. This
truck carries the necessary characters, dressed, of
course, in the costume of the period.</p>

<p>There need be none of those complicated, elaborately
colored, pyramidal structures of “staff” which endangered
the success of the Hudson-Fulton Celebration
in New York City. For they are difficult and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
costly to prepare and doubtful of effect. The effect
sought should be pictorial rather than sculpturesque.
In many cases a single small platform or table is the
only “property” required.</p>

<p>The floats in procession represent the history of the
modern struggle for liberty. This history, however,
may be depicted as fully or as sketchily as the particular
resources of each place suggest, each foreign
colony in a town working up its own float under central
supervision.</p>

<p>In our day most American cities and towns have
a large percentage of the foreign born. Let us suppose,
for example, that a certain large town consists
of the following nine nationalities: Americans,
French, Irish, Servians, Germans, Greeks, Hungarians,
Italians, and Persians. In that case its particular
pageant would consist of at least ten floats,
each attended on foot or horseback by its appropriate
escort of the same race, preferably in national costume,
and by bands of music playing—perhaps on
native instruments—those national airs most nearly
identified with the particular historical event set forth.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The American</span> float will naturally head the
procession, for precedence in this pageant is fixed by
the historical order in which the various struggles for
liberty occurred.</p>

<p>The American float might represent the Fathers sitting
about a table and signing the Declaration of Independence,
with the Liberty Bell hanging aloft. Or
it might be boat-shaped, with Washington in the bow,
crossing the Delaware and tattered soldiers straining
at the oars or poling away at imaginary ice-cakes.</p>

<p>The other floats would follow in this order:</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">France.</span> King Louis XVI is forced to recognize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
General Lafayette, the commander of the new
National Guard, on July 17, 1789, and affixes to his
own royal garments the tricolor cockade of red, blue
and white, the symbol of liberty. This event occurred
three days after the storming of the Bastille, a subject
that would not lend itself well to pictorial treatment.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Ireland.</span> Some incident from the Rebellion
of 1798. The float might be in honor of the patriotic
Society of United Irishmen and of their founder,
Theobald Wolfe Tone. Or it might represent the
dramatic betrayal, on May 19, 1798, of Lord Edward
Fitzgerald, the promised leader of the revolt.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">Servia.</span> Some incident from the splendid rebellion
of 1804 when the Serbs, who had been galled
by the Ottoman yoke for more than four centuries,
rose and drove the Turkish <i>dahis</i> out of Servia.
Their two leaders were Black George and Milosch who
have been called respectively the Achilles and the
Ulysses of Servian history. The float might give the
crucial moment in the decisive battle of Schabaz, with
Black George leading his men against those picturesque
standard-bearers of the Turkish army, the
bravest Begs of Bosnia.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">Germany.</span> It is not so easy to find a moment
in the German struggle which is both significant and
simple enough for our purpose. Perhaps the “Wartburg
Festival” would answer. Some historians treat
this incident in lighter vein, others seriously. But all
agree that the government reactionaries took it very
much to heart and at once began a reign of tyranny
that was largely responsible for the revolutions of
’30 and of historic ’48. At any rate the Festival would
make a most effective float. This was the way it
happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span></p>

<p>A couple of years after the battle of Waterloo secret
political societies were formed all over Germany
among the students and the athletes. These were
called the <i>Burschenschaften</i> and the Turners. On
October 17, 1818, several hundred of these young fellows
met at the Wartburg (the ancient castle which
had sheltered Luther after he had defied the pope and
the emperor). That evening they gathered about a
bonfire and fed it with various symbols of despotism
and with the effigies of reactionary books, while, hard
by, the Turners did exuberant gymnastic “stunts.”
This float could be made most realistic with a genuine
bonfire and a couple of Turners in the rear performing,
perhaps, on a horizontal bar. The decorations
should be in black, red and yellow, the colors of German
liberty.</p>

<p>VI. <span class="smcap">Greece.</span> The float might merely show a
group of the picturesquely costumed leaders of the
Revolution of 1821. There would be General Kolokotrones,
Marco Botzaris (the Suliote chieftain immortalized
in Fitz-Greene Halleck’s poem), Admiral
Miaoulis, Kanaris of fire-ship fame, Karaiskakis, the
daring guerilla, and Lord Byron, the poet of revolt,
who gave his life for the cause, and without whom
there might have been no Greek independence.</p>

<p>A more dramatic subject would be found in the
Greeks’ welcome of Byron when he arrived at
Missolonghi in the fall of 1823. The costumes of this
float would be particularly effective.</p>

<p>VII. <span class="smcap">Hungary.</span> One turns naturally to the events
of April 14, 1849, when, on Kossuth’s motion, the diet
proclaimed the independence of Hungary. This ought
to be as practicable as to give the signing of our own
Declaration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<p>As an alternative scheme, General Görgei could be
shown, surrounded by the evidences of some of his
victories, such as Szólnok, Isaszeg, Vácz, and
Nagysarló.</p>

<p>VIII. <span class="smcap">Italy.</span> Italian liberty might well be epitomized
in the spectacle of a red-shirted Garibaldi leaning
from the balcony of the Foresteria (the balcony
could be made out of two packing boxes and a bit of
railing) and addressing the jubilant Neapolitans on
Sept. 7, 1860, at the close of his conquest of the Two
Sicilies.</p>

<p>IX. <span class="smcap">Persia.</span> This unique float would show a
handful of the Mujteheds, or higher Mohammedan
priests, taking refuge, or “bast” before the shrine
of Shah Abdul Azim near Teheran, as they did in
1905. The taking of “bast” in some sanctuary or
other place of protection is an old Persian method
of political protest. In this case it inaugurated the recent
revolution which won Persia a constitution.</p>

<p>X. <span class="smcap">Liberty.</span> The final float would be devoted to
displaying the charms of the most statuesquely beautiful
young woman in the community,—who would be
dressed and accoutered rather like the Statue of
Liberty in New York harbor, only, one hopes, with
somewhat better taste.</p>

<p>In this order the procession would parade the principal
streets. Then, finally it would march to the
stadium (or athletic field) for the dramatic part of
the pageant, if this part were found desirable.</p>

<p>But before passing to the masque, a few more suggestions
must be offered about the parade.</p>

<p>The idea already outlined is capable of almost infinite
expansion. For most of the immigrant nations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
in our country have undergone struggles that were
inspired, directly or indirectly, by 1776.</p>

<p>Suppose a town wishes to celebrate its next Fourth
with a Liberty Pageant;—it has merely to select an
Independence Day Committee as Springfield did.
This committee prepares a list of the different local
nationalities, and decides on the most important
modern struggle for liberty in the history of each, and
finally, on the characters or events that will most
simply and effectively epitomize that struggle in float
form.</p>

<p>A few picturesque Tyrolese, for instance, could
make a thrilling picture of the gallant rising of Andreas
Hofer in 1809. The Croatians have a spirited
picture in the 1849 proclamation of their independence
of Hungary. The Poles would find a spirited subject
in the rebellion of 1830, which began with a band of
brave students trying to seize the Grand Duke Constantine
at his palace near Warsaw. Cuba could recall
her Declaration of Independence of Oct. 10, 1868,
or some event of the late war. Spain could have a
Ferrer float. Norway might remind us of her recent
bloodless separation from Sweden. Russia, of one
of the many dramatic incidents in that long, bitter
fight for liberty whose end is not yet in sight.</p>

<p>Not alone by increasing the number of participating
nations is this idea capable of almost endless development,
but also by increasing the number of floats for
each nation. The history of most of the struggles already
alluded to contains dozens of alluring subjects.
The number need be limited only by the resources and
the enthusiasm of the community.</p>

<p>Behind the national floats international ones might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
follow, representing such world-movements as those
for:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="smcap">Religious Liberty</span></li>
<li><span class="smcap">Freedom of Speech</span></li>
<li><span class="smcap">Freedom of the Press</span></li>
<li><span class="smcap">Abolition of Slavery</span></li>
<li><span class="smcap">Extension of the Elective Franchise</span></li>
<li><span class="smcap">Popularization of Government</span></li>
<li><span class="smcap">Destruction of Special Privilege</span></li>
<li><span class="smcap">Emancipation of Woman</span></li>
<li><span class="smcap">Abolition of Mob Rule</span></li>
<li><span class="smcap">Abolition of Child Labor</span></li>
<li><span class="smcap">Etc., etc.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>So much, then, for the possibilities of expanding the
idea. On the other hand it is capable of just as extreme
contraction and simplification for use in the
smaller, less wealthy communities.</p>

<p>By taking a little more care in costuming the
marching escorts an effective pageant could be arranged
with only five or six floats.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is not absolutely essential to have floats
at all. Nearly all of the situations suggested above
could be adequately represented by appropriately costumed
groups on foot; and there would even be this
positive advantage, that leaders like Garibaldi and
Kolokotrones and Black George might appear at the
head of a more realistically adequate body of troops
than could be assembled upon a float.</p>

<p>According to this plan the various foes of liberty
might also appear in force, and sham battles could be
fought in various outskirts of town earlier in the day
(let us hope, with noiseless as well as smokeless
arms!) before the various units unite in procession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span></p>

<p>If the parade is combined with the performance of
a specially written masque, the combination would obviate
many of the usual objections to the ordinary
“safe and sane” Fourth. The masque would provide
a most desirable dramatic and educative element.
And, by charging a small admission fee, this performance
would ordinarily pay the entire expense of the
celebration, including the expense of engaging a competent
pageant master. Now a pay performance without
the free parade might, under the circumstances,
be considered an undemocratic way of celebrating
what should be our most democratic holiday. But in
combination with a free parade the admission fee
would be unobjectionable, and the masque would, more
than anything else, stimulate that deep, thoughtful
patriotism whose lack to-day is as grave a defect in
our barbarous Fourth as its cruelty.</p>

<p>The idea of the masque has as yet been worked out
only tentatively. Its development is the business of
a dramatic poet. Roughly speaking it would proceed
somewhat as follows.</p>

<p>When the procession arrives at the stadium the floats
would enter in their historical order, each accompanied
however, by only the small, specially trained nucleus
of its marching escort. The floats would circle the
inclosure once or twice, and then divide into two files,
forming a lane of honor through which the Liberty
float would move slowly and take up a position in the
center of the inclosure.</p>

<p>Its escort would then sing a chorus which ought to
be as eloquent and beautiful and suggestive an exposition
of the nature of abstract liberty as Swinburne’s
“Hertha” is of the soul.</p>

<p>When this is finished the Americans would approach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
this central figure of Liberty and recount, with
music and dramatic action, perhaps, their struggle in
her honor, ending with America sung with full chorus
and band. Then the Americans would take up their
position in the secondary place of honor opposite.</p>

<p>Hereupon, keeping to their historic order, each
nation would advance and after greeting the American
float as the pioneer of liberty, would approach
the goddess and briefly recite their deeds in her behalf,
each particularly emphasizing the unique qualities
which it brought to its own struggle, and which it
is ready (by application) to bring to any further struggles
in the same general cause.</p>

<p>These national recitals might be managed in various
ways. Dependent upon the size of the stadium and
the available creative talent among the organizers,
they might be spoken or sung, solo or in chorus, in
prose or verse, or both. Of course it is desirable
that the masque should be composed entirely by the
best poet and set to music by the most inspired composer
obtainable. But it is quite conceivable that
local amateurs might rise to very satisfactory heights
in an emergency.</p>

<p>Even in case of rain it might still be possible for
the leading characters to present this masque upon the
stage of the largest local theater concert hall.</p>

<p>After each nation has separately recounted its
prowess, and all are grouped effectively around the
central figure, Liberty reminds them that though they
have done heroic deeds in the past, much remains to
accomplish in the present, even in this land of the free.
She then proceeds to describe what foes still menace
our real freedom in America, such foes as special
privilege, mob rule, political corruption, white slavery,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
treatment of the feeble-minded as common criminals,
a capitalistic press, and so on.</p>

<p>Then in the final grand chorus the united nations
would join together in proclaiming that, strengthened
by their separate struggles overseas, they here and
now unite their efforts to make this land, in deed as
in name, the land of liberty.</p>

<p>Could anything make more swiftly and surely for
national solidarity than in some such way to stimulate
each national element in our forming civilization to
bring the best it has to the service of the future
America? And what more patriotic and fitting deed
could be accomplished than to transform the birthday
of modern liberty from a day of meaningless
destruction into a day of construction fraught with
profound and beautiful significance?</p>
